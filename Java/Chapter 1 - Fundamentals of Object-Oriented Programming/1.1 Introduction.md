**Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** is an approach to program organization and development, which attempts to eliminate some of the pitfalls of conventional programming methods by incorporating the best of structured programming features with several new concepts.

OOP has nothing to do with any particular language.

Java is a pure object oriented language.
