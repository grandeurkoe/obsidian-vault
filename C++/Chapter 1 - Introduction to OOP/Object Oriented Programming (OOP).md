# Structured Programming

With the advent of languages such as c, structured programming became very popular and was the main technique of the 1980â€™s. **Structured programming** was a powerful tool that enabled programmers to write moderately complex programs fairly easily. However, as the programs grew larger, even the structured approach failed to show the desired result in terms of bug-free, easy-to- maintain, and reusable programs.

# Object Oriented Programming (OOP)

**Object Oriented Programming (OOP)** is an approach to program organization and development that attempts to eliminate some of the pitfalls of conventional programming methods by incorporating the best of structured programming features with several powerful new concepts. It is a new way of organizing and developing programs and has nothing to do with any particular language. However, not all languages are suitable to implement the OOP concepts easily.
