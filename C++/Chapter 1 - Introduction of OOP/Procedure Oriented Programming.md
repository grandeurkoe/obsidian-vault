In the procedure oriented approach, the problem is viewed as the sequence of things to
be done such as reading, calculating and printing such as cobol, fortran and c. The
primary focus is on functions. A typical structure for procedural programming is shown
in fig.1.2. The technique of hierarchical decomposition has been used to specify the tasks
to be completed for solving a problem.
