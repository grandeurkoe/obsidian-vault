With the advent of languages such as c, structured programming became very popular
and was the main technique of the 1980â€™s. Structured programming was a powerful tool
that enabled programmers to write moderately complex programs fairly easily. However,
as the programs grew larger, even the structured approach failed to show the desired
result in terms of bug-free, easy-to- maintain, and reusable programs.
