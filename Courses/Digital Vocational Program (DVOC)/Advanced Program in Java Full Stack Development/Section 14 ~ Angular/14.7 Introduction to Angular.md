### **What is Angular?**

Angular is a **TypeScript-based** open-source web application framework developed and maintained by the **Angular Team at Google**, along with contributions from the community. It is a **complete rewrite** of its predecessor, **AngularJS**, and is designed for building **efficient** and **sophisticated single-page applications (SPAs)**.

#### Key Points:

- **Framework Type**: Angular is a **front-end framework** used to build modern web applications.
- **TypeScript**: Angular is built using TypeScript, which is a superset of JavaScript that adds static types and modern features for better development experiences.
- **Single-Page Applications (SPAs)**: Angular is primarily used for building SPAs, where content dynamically loads without refreshing the entire page.
- **Component-Based Architecture**: Angular uses a component-based approach, where the UI is split into reusable, self-contained units.

### **Angular Architecture**

Angular follows a **modular** architecture to build applications. The primary building blocks include:

1. **Modules**:
    - Angular applications are modularized into **NgModules**. Every Angular application has at least one module, the root module, usually named `AppModule`.
2. **Components**:
    - **Components** define views in Angular applications. They control the **UI** by combining a template, a class, and styles.
    - Each component is associated with an HTML template and CSS styles.
3. **Templates**:
    - Templates define the structure and layout of a component. Angular provides directives and bindings to render dynamic content.
4. **Services**:
    - Angular services handle business logic, data access, and logic that is shared across multiple components.
5. **Directives**:
    - Directives are used to extend HTML functionality and create custom behavior for DOM elements.
6. **Pipes**:
    - Pipes are used to transform data in templates, such as formatting dates or currency.

### **Features of Angular**

Angular comes with a wide variety of built-in features to help developers build robust and scalable applications efficiently:

1. **Two-Way Data Binding**:
    - Angular allows synchronization of data between the model and view, so updates to the model reflect in the view, and user interactions on the view are reflected back in the model.
2. **Component-Based Architecture**:
    - Angular applications are built using components that encapsulate both the logic and UI.
3. **Dependency Injection**:
    - Angular uses **dependency injection** (DI) to manage services and objects needed by components and other services, making code more modular and easier to test.
4. **Routing**:
    - Angular provides a **router** for navigating between views, making it easier to implement navigation for SPAs.
5. **RxJS and Observables**:
    - Angular uses **RxJS** to handle asynchronous operations. It leverages **Observables** to manage events, HTTP requests, and data streams.
6. **CLI (Command-Line Interface)**:
    - The Angular CLI is a powerful tool that helps you with scaffolding, running, testing, and deploying Angular applications.
7. **Forms Handling**:
    - Angular provides **template-driven** and **reactive** forms for handling user input with validation.
8. **Testing**:
    - Angular has built-in support for **unit testing** and **end-to-end testing** using **Karma** and **Jasmine**.

### **Angular Installation**

To start using Angular, follow the installation process:

1. **Prerequisites**:
    
    - Install **Node.js** and **npm** (Node Package Manager), which are required for running Angular projects.
        
2. **Install Angular CLI**:
    
    - To install the Angular CLI globally, use the following command:
    
    ```bash
    npm install -g @angular/cli
    ```
    
3. **Verify Installation**:
    
    - After installing, you can verify the version of Angular CLI by typing:
    
    ```bash
    ng --version
    ```

### **Create and Run Angular Project**

Once Angular CLI is installed, you can create and run your Angular projects easily.

1. **Create a New Project**:
    
    - Use the `ng new` command to create a new Angular project:
    
    ```bash
    ng new welcomeproject
    ```
    
    Here, `welcomeproject` is the name of your Angular application. The command will create a project structure and install dependencies for you.
    
2. **Navigate to Your Project**:
    
    - After creating your project, move into the project folder:
    
    ```bash
    cd welcomeproject
    ```
    
3. **Run Your Angular Project**:
    
    - To serve (run) your Angular application locally, use the following command:
    
    ```bash
    ng serve --o
    ```
    
    - This will build the application and open it in the default browser, usually at `http://localhost:4200/`. The `--o` flag automatically opens the browser.
