## **TypeScript Classes**

TypeScript enhances JavaScript classes by adding type annotations for properties and methods, as well as visibility modifiers to control access to class members. This helps ensure better structure and maintainability for large applications.

### **1. Members: Types**

In TypeScript, class members (both properties and methods) can be explicitly typed using type annotations, just like variables. This helps with type safety and ensures that the correct types are used when interacting with the class.

#### **Example:**

```typescript
class Person {
    name: string;  // Property with a type annotation

    constructor(name: string) {
        this.name = name; // Initializing the property
    }
}

const person = new Person("Jane");
console.log(person.name);  // Output: Jane
```

- **Explanation**:
    - `name: string;` specifies that the `name` property of the `Person` class must always be a `string`.
    - In the constructor, the `name` property is initialized with the provided string value.

### **2. Members: Visibility Modifiers**

TypeScript allows you to control the visibility of class members (properties and methods) using three different visibility modifiers. These modifiers determine how and where the class members can be accessed.

There are three main visibility modifiers in TypeScript:

#### **a. `public`** (Default)

The `public` modifier allows access to the class member from anywhere, whether inside the class or outside. If no modifier is specified, the member is considered `public` by default.

- **Example**:

```typescript
class Person {
    public name: string;  // `public` allows access from anywhere

    constructor(name: string) {
        this.name = name;
    }
}

const person = new Person("John");
console.log(person.name);  // Accessible outside the class
```

#### **b. `private`**

The `private` modifier restricts access to the class member from **outside** the class. Private members can only be accessed within the class where they are defined.

- **Example**:

```typescript
class Person {
    private name: string;  // `private` limits access to within the class

    constructor(name: string) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    public getName(): string {
        return this.name;  // Accessing private member from within the class
    }
}

const person = new Person("Alice");
console.log(person.getName());  // Accessible through a public method

// Error: Property 'name' is private and only accessible within class 'Person'.
// console.log(person.name);
```

- **Explanation**:
    - The `name` property is declared as `private`, so it cannot be accessed directly from outside the class. It can only be accessed within the class or through a public method like `getName()`.

#### **c. `protected`**

The `protected` modifier allows access to the class member within the class itself and any **subclasses** that inherit from it. Unlike `private`, `protected` members are accessible by derived classes.

- **Example**:

```typescript
class Person {
    protected name: string;  // `protected` allows access within the class and its subclasses

    constructor(name: string) {
        this.name = name;
    }
}

class Employee extends Person {
    public getEmployeeName(): string {
        return this.name;  // Accessing protected member in the derived class
    }
}

const employee = new Employee("Robert");
console.log(employee.getEmployeeName());  // Accessible through a subclass method

// Error: Property 'name' is protected and only accessible within class 'Person' and its subclasses.
// console.log(employee.name);
```

- **Explanation**:
    - The `name` property is marked as `protected`. This allows it to be accessed within the `Person` class and its subclass `Employee`, but not from outside either class.

### **Summary of Visibility Modifiers**

1. **`public`** (default):
    - Members are accessible from anywhere, both inside and outside the class.
    - This is the default if no modifier is specified.
2. **`private`**:
    - Members are **only accessible** within the class itself. They cannot be accessed from outside or from subclasses.
3. **`protected`**:
    - Members are **accessible** within the class and in any **subclasses** that inherit from the class, but not from outside the class hierarchy.

### **Complete Example**

```typescript
class Person {
    public name: string;
    private age: number;
    protected address: string;

    constructor(name: string, age: number, address: string) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
        this.address = address;
    }

    public getAge(): number {
        return this.age;  // Accessing private member through a public method
    }
}

class Employee extends Person {
    public displayInfo(): void {
        console.log(`Name: ${this.name}`);  // Accessing public member
        console.log(`Address: ${this.address}`);  // Accessing protected member
        // Error: Property 'age' is private and only accessible within class 'Person'.
        // console.log(`Age: ${this.age}`);
    }
}

const employee = new Employee("John", 30, "123 Main St");
employee.displayInfo();
console.log(employee.getAge());  // Accessing private member via public method
```

By using **TypeScriptâ€™s class members** with proper **visibility modifiers**, you gain better control over your code and prevent unwanted access to sensitive data. This leads to more maintainable, structured, and safer code.
