### **Commonly Used Structural Directives in Angular**

Structural directives are used to change the structure of the DOM by adding, removing, or manipulating elements based on certain conditions. They can be easily recognized because they have an asterisk (`*`) before them in the template. The three most commonly used structural directives in Angular are:

---

### **1. `ngIf` Directive**

The `ngIf` directive conditionally includes or excludes elements in the DOM based on a Boolean expression. When the expression is true, the element is added to the DOM; when false, the element is removed.

#### Syntax:

```html
<div *ngIf="condition">
  This content is displayed if the condition is true.
</div>
```

#### Example:

```html
<p *ngIf="isVisible">This paragraph will only appear if the variable isVisible is true.</p>
```

In the component:

```typescript
export class AppComponent {
  isVisible = true;
}
```

#### **Key Notes:**

- `ngIf` can also be used with `else` to display an alternative content when the condition is false.
    
    Example with `else`:
    
    ```html
    <div *ngIf="isLoggedIn; else login">
      Welcome back!
    </div>
    <ng-template #login>
      <div>Please log in</div>
    </ng-template>
    ```

### **2. `ngFor` Directive**

The `ngFor` directive is used to loop over an array or list and display the elements in the template. It creates a new instance of the element for each item in the array.

#### Syntax:

```html
<div *ngFor="let item of items">
  {{ item }}
</div>
```

#### Example:

```html
<ul>
  <li *ngFor="let student of students">
    {{ student.name }} ({{ student.age }} years old)
  </li>
</ul>
```

In the component:

```typescript
export class AppComponent {
  students = [
    { name: 'Alice', age: 21 },
    { name: 'Bob', age: 25 },
    { name: 'Charlie', age: 22 }
  ];
}
```

#### **Key Notes:**

- You can access the index of the current item in the loop using the `index` variable.
    
    Example with index:
    
    ```html
    <ul>
      <li *ngFor="let student of students; let i = index">
        {{ i + 1 }}. {{ student.name }}
      </li>
    </ul>
    ```
    
- You can also use `trackBy` to optimize performance by tracking items by a unique identifier.
    
    Example with `trackBy`:
    
    ```html
    <ul>
      <li *ngFor="let student of students; trackBy: trackById">
        {{ student.name }}
      </li>
    </ul>
    ```
    
    In the component:
    
    ```typescript
    trackById(index: number, item: any): number {
      return item.id; // Use the unique id to track the items
    }
    ```
    

---

### **3. `ngSwitch` Directive**

The `ngSwitch` directive is used to display one of several elements based on a condition. It is like a switch-case statement in traditional programming languages.

#### Syntax:

```html
<div [ngSwitch]="expression">
  <div *ngSwitchCase="'value1'">Content for value1</div>
  <div *ngSwitchCase="'value2'">Content for value2</div>
  <div *ngSwitchDefault>Content for default case</div>
</div>
```

#### Example:

```html
<div [ngSwitch]="currentStatus">
  <div *ngSwitchCase="'active'">The status is Active</div>
  <div *ngSwitchCase="'inactive'">The status is Inactive</div>
  <div *ngSwitchCase="'pending'">The status is Pending</div>
  <div *ngSwitchDefault>Unknown Status</div>
</div>
```

In the component:

```typescript
export class AppComponent {
  currentStatus = 'active';
}
```

#### **Key Notes:**

- `ngSwitch` works together with `ngSwitchCase` and `ngSwitchDefault`.
- Only one `ngSwitchCase` will be displayed based on the evaluated expression.

### **Conclusion**

- **`ngIf`**: Used for conditional rendering of elements. Itâ€™s perfect for showing or hiding elements based on conditions.
- **`ngFor`**: Used to iterate over arrays or lists and display the elements dynamically.
- **`ngSwitch`**: Used to handle multiple possible conditions and display the corresponding content based on a matching case.

These structural directives are powerful tools that allow Angular developers to manipulate the DOM efficiently based on dynamic conditions, ensuring that your application is both interactive and responsive.
