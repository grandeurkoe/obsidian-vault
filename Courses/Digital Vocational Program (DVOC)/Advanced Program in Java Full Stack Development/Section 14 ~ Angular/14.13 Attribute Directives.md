### **Attribute Directives in Angular**

An **Attribute Directive** in Angular is a type of directive that changes the appearance or behavior of an element, component, or another directive. It is applied as an attribute to HTML elements and does not alter the DOM structure. Instead, it modifies the properties or behavior of an element.

### **Key Characteristics of Attribute Directives:**

1. **Dynamic Behavior**: They are used to add dynamic behavior to HTML elements. For example, you can change the appearance of an element based on some condition or update an element's style dynamically.
2. **Works as HTML Attributes**: You apply an attribute directive as an HTML attribute on an element.
3. **Reusability**: You can reuse attribute directives across multiple components and elements.

### **Common Examples of Attribute Directives:**

1. **`ngClass`**:
    
    - `ngClass` is an Angular attribute directive used to add or remove CSS classes dynamically.
    - It binds a class to an element conditionally based on the expression passed to it.
    
    Example:
    
    ```html
    <div [ngClass]="{ 'highlight': isHighlighted }">This content is highlighted if isHighlighted is true.</div>
    ```
    
2. **`ngStyle`**:
    
    - `ngStyle` is an Angular directive that is used to set inline styles dynamically.
    - You can apply multiple styles by binding it to an object where each key is a style property and the value is the corresponding style value.
    
    Example:
    
    ```html
    <div [ngStyle]="{ 'color': textColor, 'font-size': fontSize }">Styled content</div>
    ```
    
3. **`ngModel`**:
    
    - `ngModel` is used for two-way data binding. It connects an input element with a variable in the component.
    - It allows you to bind the value of a form control (like input, select, etc.) to a property in the component class and vice versa.
    
    Example:
    
    ```html
    <input [(ngModel)]="userName" placeholder="Enter your name" />
    ```
    
4. **`ngIf` (While it is often considered a structural directive, in certain use cases, it can be considered as working like an attribute as well)**:
    
    - It conditionally includes or excludes elements from the DOM based on a boolean expression. 
    
    Example:
    
    ```html
    <div *ngIf="isVisible">This content is conditionally displayed.</div>
    ```
    
5. **Custom Attribute Directives**:
    
    - You can create custom attribute directives to implement your own reusable logic. These directives can modify the appearance or behavior of an element.
    
    Example of a simple custom attribute directive that changes the background color of an element:
    
    ```typescript
    import { Directive, ElementRef, Renderer2, HostListener } from '@angular/core';
    
    @Directive({
      selector: '[appHighlight]'
    })
    export class HighlightDirective {
      constructor(private el: ElementRef, private renderer: Renderer2) { }
    
      @HostListener('mouseenter') onMouseEnter() {
        this.renderer.setStyle(this.el.nativeElement, 'background-color', 'yellow');
      }
    
      @HostListener('mouseleave') onMouseLeave() {
        this.renderer.removeStyle(this.el.nativeElement, 'background-color');
      }
    }
    ```
    
    Usage in the template:
    
    ```html
    <div appHighlight>Hover over this div to change its background color</div>
    ```

### **How to Create a Custom Attribute Directive in Angular?**

1. **Step 1**: Create a directive file.
    
    - Use the Angular CLI command: `ng g directive highlight`.
        
2. **Step 2**: Implement the directive logic in the newly generated directive class.
    
    Example of a simple custom directive:
    
    ```typescript
    import { Directive, ElementRef, Renderer2 } from '@angular/core';
    
    @Directive({
      selector: '[appHighlight]'
    })
    export class HighlightDirective {
      constructor(private el: ElementRef, private renderer: Renderer2) { 
        this.renderer.setStyle(this.el.nativeElement, 'color', 'blue');
      }
    }
    ```
    
3. **Step 3**: Use your custom directive in your template.
    
    ```html
    <div appHighlight>This text will be highlighted in blue.</div>
    ```
    
4. **Step 4**: Declare the directive in your module (typically `app.module.ts`):
    
    ```typescript
    import { HighlightDirective } from './highlight.directive';
    
    @NgModule({
      declarations: [HighlightDirective],
      ...
    })
    export class AppModule { }
    ```

### **Conclusion**

- **Attribute Directives** enhance HTML elements by adding behavior, style, or functionality dynamically.
- They are applied as attributes on DOM elements and can change an elementâ€™s style, class, or other properties.
- Angular provides built-in directives like `ngClass`, `ngStyle`, and `ngModel`, and you can also create custom directives to suit your needs.
- Custom directives allow you to encapsulate reusable logic that can be applied to many elements across your app.
