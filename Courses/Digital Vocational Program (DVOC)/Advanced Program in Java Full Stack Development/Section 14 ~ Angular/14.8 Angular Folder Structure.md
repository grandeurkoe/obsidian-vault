[`*node_modules/` - The `npm` package installed is `node_modules`. You can open the folder and see the packages available.
`*src/` - This folder is where we will work on the project using Angular 7.Inside `src/` you will app/folder created during the project setup and holds all the required files required for the project.
The angular16-app/folder has the following file structure -
- `*angular.json` - It basically holds the project name, version of cli, etc.
- `*.editorconfig` - This is the config file for the editor.
- `*.gitignore` - A `.gitignore` file should be committed into the repository, in order to share the ignore rules with any other users that clone the repository.
- `*package.json` - The `package.json` file tells which libraries will be installed into `node_modules` when you run `npm` install.

![[Folder Structure (Part 2).jpg]]](<### **Angular Folder Structure**

When you create a new Angular project, it generates a specific folder structure to organize your code and assets. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of some key folders and files you'll encounter in an Angular project:

---

#### **Main Folders:**

1. **`node_modules/`**  
   - This folder contains all the **npm packages** and dependencies installed in the project.
   - **Purpose**: Holds all the libraries required by your Angular application.
   - **Note**: You typically do not modify or directly interact with this folder. It is managed by npm.

2. **`src/`**  
   - The `src/` folder is where all the **source code** for your Angular project resides.
   - Inside `src/`, you will find subfolders and files like:
     - **`app/`**: Contains the main application code, including components, services, and other Angular elements.
     - **`assets/`**: A folder to store static resources such as images, fonts, and other assets.
     - **`environments/`**: Configurations for different environments (development, production).
     - **`index.html`**: The main HTML file for the application.
     - **`styles.css`**: Global styles for the application.

---

#### **Important Files:**

1. **`angular.json`**  
   - This file contains the configuration for your Angular project, including:
     - Project name
     - CLI version
     - File paths and assets to include
     - Build and development settings
   - **Purpose**: Defines how Angular's CLI should build and serve the project.

2. **`.editorconfig`**  
   - A configuration file that helps define coding style rules for your editor.
   - **Purpose**: Ensures consistent code formatting across different editors and environments (e.g., tabs vs spaces, line endings).

3. **`.gitignore`**  
   - The `.gitignore` file contains a list of files and folders that should be ignored by version control (Git).
   - **Purpose**: Prevents unnecessary or sensitive files (like `node_modules/`, build output, and environment settings) from being committed to the repository.

4. **`package.json`**  
   - The `package.json` file holds metadata about your project, such as:
     - Project dependencies (libraries to be installed)
     - Scripts for build, testing, and running the project
     - Version of the application
   - **Purpose**: Tells npm which packages to install and how to run various tasks (e.g., `npm start`, `npm run build`).

This image showcases the typical folder structure that you would find in an Angular project, helping you visualize where specific files and folders are located.

---

### **Summary:**

- **`node_modules/`**: Contains installed npm packages and dependencies.
- **`src/`**: Contains source code for your application.
- **`angular.json`**: Configuration file for project settings.
- **`.editorconfig`**: Defines editor settings for consistent coding style.
- **`.gitignore`**: Lists files and directories to ignore in Git version control.
- **`package.json`**: Specifies project metadata, dependencies, and scripts.

This structure ensures that the Angular project is well-organized and modular, making it easier to manage, scale, and maintain the application.>)
