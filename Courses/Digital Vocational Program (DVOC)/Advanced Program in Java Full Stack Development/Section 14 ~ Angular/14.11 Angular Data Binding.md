### **What is Angular Data Binding?**

Angular Data Binding is a mechanism that allows you to coordinate the interaction between the component class and its template (view). It enables synchronization of data between the component and the view, which makes the view reactive to changes in the data and vice versa.

In Angular, data binding is categorized into different types:

1. **One-Way Data Binding**:
    - **Interpolation**: Data flows from the component to the view.
    - **Property Binding**: Data flows from the component to the view by binding a property to an element's attribute.
        
2. **Two-Way Data Binding**:
    - Data flows both from the component to the view and from the view to the component. Changes in the view are automatically reflected in the component, and vice versa.

### **One-Way Data Binding**

#### **1. Interpolation (One-Way Data Binding)**

**Interpolation** is a way of embedding the values of component properties directly into the template using `{{ }}`. This is used for displaying values in the view.

**Example**:

```html
<h1>{{ title }}</h1>
```

Here, `title` is a property of the component class, and its value will be displayed in the `<h1>` tag in the view.

#### **2. Property Binding (One-Way Data Binding)**

**Property Binding** is used to bind values to an elementâ€™s property (e.g., `src`, `disabled`, etc.). It allows the component to set values dynamically to properties of elements in the view.

**Syntax**: `[property]="expression"`

**Example**:

```html
<img [src]="imageUrl" alt="Image">
```

Here, the `src` attribute of the `img` tag is bound to the `imageUrl` property in the component class. If the value of `imageUrl` changes, the `src` will update automatically.

### **Two-Way Data Binding**

Two-way data binding enables synchronization of data between the component and the view. Changes made in the view (for example, in form elements) are automatically updated in the component class, and changes in the component class reflect in the view as well.

To enable **two-way data binding**, we use `ngModel` in Angular. But first, you need to import `FormsModule` in your `app.module.ts` file.

**Steps to enable two-way data binding:**

1. Open `app.module.ts`.
2. Import `FormsModule` from `@angular/forms`.
3. Add `FormsModule` to the `imports` array in the `@NgModule` decorator.

**Example**:

```ts
import { FormsModule } from '@angular/forms';

@NgModule({
  declarations: [ AppComponent ],
  imports: [ BrowserModule, FormsModule ],
  providers: [],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent]
})
export class AppModule { }
```

Now, you can use two-way binding with the `[(ngModel)]` syntax.

**Example**:

```html
<input [(ngModel)]="userName" />
<p>Your name is: {{ userName }}</p>
```

In this example, as you type in the input field, the value of `userName` is updated automatically, and it is also displayed in the paragraph.

### **Cheat Sheet for Data Binding**

- **Interpolation**:  
    `{{ expression }}`
    
    - Example: `<h1>{{ title }}</h1>`
        
- **Property Binding**:  
    `[property]="expression"`
    
    - Example: `<img [src]="imageUrl" alt="Image">`
        
- **Event Binding**:  
    `(event)="handler"`
    
    - Example: `<button (click)="onClick()">Click me</button>`
        
- **Two-Way Data Binding**:  
    `[(ngModel)]="property"`
    
    - Example: `<input [(ngModel)]="userName">`

### **Summary of Data Binding Types**:

- **One-Way Data Binding**: Data flows in one direction (from component to view).
    
    - Interpolation: `{{ expression }}`
    - Property Binding: `[property]="expression"`
        
- **Two-Way Data Binding**: Data flows in both directions (from component to view and view to component).
    
    - Syntax: `[(ngModel)]="property"`
