### **What is an Angular Component?**

An **Angular Component** is a building block of an Angular application. Each component is essentially a unit of functionality that encapsulates logic and the view (UI). Components are the most fundamental building blocks of Angular applications and they allow developers to create reusable, modular pieces of code.

Every Angular component consists of:

- **HTML Template**: Defines the structure and layout of the view for the component.
- **CSS/Styles**: Used to define the look and feel of the component.
- **TypeScript Class**: Contains the logic for the component, like properties, methods, and lifecycle hooks.
- **Metadata**: Provided by Angular via decorators to associate the component class with its template and styles.

### **How to Create a Component in Angular?**

To generate a new component in Angular, you can use Angular CLI commands. Here's how to create a component:

```bash
ng g component hello
```

In this example, `hello` is the name of the component, and Angular CLI will automatically create the necessary files and boilerplate code for the component.

### **How to Create a Class in Angular?**

Similarly, you can also generate a class using the Angular CLI:

```bash
ng g class Product
```

This will create a TypeScript class `Product` in your project directory.

### **Building Blocks of Angular Component**

The building blocks of an Angular component are as follows:

1. **Component Class**:
    - The component class is a TypeScript class that contains logic and properties used in the component.
    - It is decorated with `@Component` and typically defines component properties and methods.
2. **Template**:
    - The template defines the HTML view of the component. It uses Angularâ€™s templating syntax to create dynamic and reusable views.
    - Angular provides **data binding** (interpolation, property binding, event binding) to make templates interactive with the component class.
3. **Styles**:
    - The styles define how the component will look. These styles can be scoped to the component to ensure they only apply to that specific component.
4. **Metadata**:
    - Metadata is defined using the `@Component` decorator. It tells Angular how to associate the component with the HTML template, CSS styles, and other important properties.
    - The decorator contains properties like `selector`, `templateUrl`, `styleUrls`, etc.

### **Example of an Angular Component**:

Below is a simple example of an Angular component:

```typescript
import { Component } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-hello',  // Defines the HTML tag for the component
  templateUrl: './hello.component.html',  // Points to the HTML template
  styleUrls: ['./hello.component.css']  // Points to the CSS styles
})
export class HelloComponent {
  title = 'Hello, Angular!';  // Property used in the template

  // Method to greet
  greet() {
    return 'Welcome to Angular!';
  }
}
```

**hello.component.html:**

```html
<h1>{{ title }}</h1>  <!-- Data Binding -->
<p>{{ greet() }}</p>  <!-- Method Binding -->
```

**hello.component.css:**

```css
h1 {
  color: blue;
}
```

### **Key Concepts Related to Angular Components:**

1. **Selector**:
    - The selector defines the custom HTML tag that can be used in the parent component's template to include the child component. In the above example, `<app-hello></app-hello>` will render the `HelloComponent`.
2. **Template**:
    - Templates in Angular define the view (UI) for the component. They can be defined inline with the `template` property or linked via a separate HTML file with the `templateUrl` property.
3. **Styles**:
    - Styles are used to define how the component's view will look. Like templates, styles can be defined inline with the `styles` property or linked via an external CSS file with the `styleUrls` property.
4. **Data Binding**:
    - Data binding allows synchronization between the component class and the view (HTML). Types of data binding in Angular:
        - **Interpolation**: `{{ variableName }}`
        - **Property Binding**: `[property]="expression"`
        - **Event Binding**: `(event)="handler"`
5. **Component Lifecycle**:
    - Components go through a lifecycle of events from creation to destruction. Angular provides lifecycle hooks to manage these events, like `ngOnInit`, `ngOnDestroy`, `ngOnChanges`, etc.

### **Summary of Key Points**:

- **Angular Components** are the core building blocks of Angular applications.
- Components consist of a **TypeScript class**, **HTML template**, and **CSS styles**.
- Angular provides **data binding** and **event handling** to make components interactive.
- **Angular CLI** makes it easy to generate components with the `ng g component` command.
