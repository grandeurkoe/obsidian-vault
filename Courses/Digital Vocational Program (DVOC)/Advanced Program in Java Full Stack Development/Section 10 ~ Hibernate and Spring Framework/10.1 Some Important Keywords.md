## Entity

An *entity* is any object, place, person, or activity about which data is recorded. 

An entity can be categorized as *entity type* and *entity instance*.

An *entity type* is a set of things that share common properties. An *entity instance* is an individual occurrence of an entity type. For example, John is an instance of the STUDENT entity type.

An entity, which depends on another entity for existence, is called a *dependent entity or weak entity*. An entity that does not depend on any other entity for existence are called *regular entities*.

## Relationships

*Relationship* is defined as an association among entities.

A relationship can be categorized as *relationship type* and *relationship instance*.

A *relationship type* is an association of entity types and a *relationship instance* is an association of entity instance. For example, the association between a student called J. Reins and the teacher called Dr. Jack.

There are the following types of relationship:
1. One-to-One
2. One-to-Many (or Many-to-One)
3. Many-to-Many

## Attributes

An *attribute* is a property of a given entity. For example, ROLL_NO is a property of entity, STUDENT.

Similar to entities, attributes can also have instances. An *attribute instance* is an individual occurrence of an attribute. For example, roll number 101 is the instance of the attribute, ROLL_NO.
