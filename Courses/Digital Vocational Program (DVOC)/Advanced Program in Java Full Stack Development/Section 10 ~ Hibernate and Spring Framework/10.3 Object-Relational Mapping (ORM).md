## Hibernate Framework

*Hibernate* is a java based ORM tool that provides a framework for mapping application domain model objects to the relational database tables and visa versa.

*JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)* is a low level API in Java that allows you to execute SQL queries and update statements directly.

Hibernate sits on top of JDBC and provides a higher level, more abstract way to interact with the database.

Hibernate allows you to work with your database in a way that doesnâ€™t tie you to a specific database type. This means you can switch between different databases (like MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle) with minimal changes to your code.

Hibernate provides an ORM implementation that maps your database records to Java objects and generates the required SQL statements to replicate all operations to the database.
