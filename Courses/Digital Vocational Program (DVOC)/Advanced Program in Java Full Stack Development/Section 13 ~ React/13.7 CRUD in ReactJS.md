## **How to Work with JSON File Using JSON Server**

JSON Server allows you to quickly create a REST API based on a JSON file, making it great for testing or building simple apps that require CRUD operations.

### **Steps to Set Up and Work with a JSON File**

---

### 1. **Create a JSON File**

You need to create a `.json` file that contains the data you want to work with. In this example, we'll create a `student.json` file with sample student data.

Create a file called `student.json` with the following content:

```json
{
  "student": [
    {
      "id": "1",
      "studname": "Rahul",
      "emailid": "rahul@gmail.com",
      "cellno": "987654321"
    },
    {
      "id": "2",
      "studname": "Meena",
      "emailid": "meena@gmail.com",
      "cellno": "987654351"
    },
    {
      "id": "3",
      "studname": "Ram",
      "emailid": "ram@gmail.com",
      "cellno": "987654348"
    },
    {
      "id": "4",
      "studname": "Vishal",
      "emailid": "vishal@gmail.com",
      "cellno": "987654314"
    },
    {
      "id": "5",
      "studname": "Sig",
      "emailid": "sig@gmail.com",
      "cellno": "987654345"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 2. **Install JSON Server**

To use **JSON Server**, you need to install it globally. Follow these steps:

1. **Open the Integrated Terminal**:
    
    - Right-click on the `student.json` file in your code editor and select **"Open in Integrated Terminal"** (for Visual Studio Code).
        
2. **Install JSON Server**: In the terminal, run the following command to install `json-server` globally:
    
    ```bash
    npm install -g json-server
    ```
    
    This command will install **JSON Server** globally on your system, allowing you to run it from anywhere in the terminal.

### 3. **Run the JSON File Using JSON Server**

Once **JSON Server** is installed, you can use it to run the JSON file and create a mock REST API.

1. **Run the JSON File**: In the terminal (with the `student.json` file open), execute the following command:
    
    ```bash
    json-server student.json
    ```
    
    This will start a local server and serve the JSON data as a REST API.
    
2. **Access the API**: By default, the server will run on `http://localhost:3000`. You can interact with the following endpoints:
    
    - **GET all students**: `http://localhost:3000/student`
        
    - **GET a specific student**: `http://localhost:3000/student/1` (replace `1` with the desired `id`).
        
    - **POST (Create) a new student**: `http://localhost:3000/student` (use a POST request).
        
    - **PUT (Update) a student**: `http://localhost:3000/student/1` (replace `1` with the `id`).
        
    - **DELETE (Delete) a student**: `http://localhost:3000/student/1` (replace `1` with the `id`).

### **CRUD Operations Using JSON Server**

Hereâ€™s how you can use **CRUD** operations with **JSON Server**:

#### **C: Create (POST)**

To create a new student, you can send a **POST** request to the `student` endpoint.

**Example**:

```json
POST /student
{
  "id": "6",
  "studname": "John",
  "emailid": "john@example.com",
  "cellno": "987654399"
}
```

This will add a new student to the list.

#### **R: Retrieve (GET)**

To retrieve the student data, you can send **GET** requests.

**Example**:

- To get all students:  
    `GET http://localhost:3000/student`
    
- To get a specific student by `id`:  
    `GET http://localhost:3000/student/1` (where `1` is the student ID).
    

#### **U: Update (PUT)**

To update an existing student, you can send a **PUT** request.

**Example**:

```json
PUT /student/1
{
  "id": "1",
  "studname": "Rahul Kumar",
  "emailid": "rahulkumar@gmail.com",
  "cellno": "987654310"
}
```

This will update the student with `id: 1` with the new details.

#### **D: Delete (DELETE)**

To delete a student, you can send a **DELETE** request.

**Example**:

```bash
DELETE /student/1
```

This will delete the student with `id: 1`.

### **Additional Notes**:

- **Customizing JSON Server**: You can customize the server behavior by adding a `json-server.json` file or using flags like `--port` to change the port number, or `--watch` to keep it in watch mode.
    
- **Server Running in Watch Mode**: If you want the server to automatically reload when the `student.json` file changes, you can run:
    
    ```bash
    json-server --watch student.json
    ```
    
- **Advanced Features**: You can add query parameters to filter, sort, or paginate data. For example:
    
    - `GET /student?_sort=studname&_order=asc` will sort the students by `studname` in ascending order.
        
    - `GET /student?_page=1&_limit=2` will return only two students (pagination).

### **Conclusion**:

By following these steps, you've successfully created a JSON-based API using **JSON Server**, which you can use to perform **CRUD operations** on your data. This is a quick and effective way to mock RESTful APIs for testing, prototyping, or building simple front-end applications that require a backend.
