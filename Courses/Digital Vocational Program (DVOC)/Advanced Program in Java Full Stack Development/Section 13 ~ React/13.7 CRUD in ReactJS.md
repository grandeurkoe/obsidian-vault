## **How to Work with JSON File Using JSON Server**

JSON Server is a powerful tool that allows you to quickly set up a REST API based on a JSON file. It's perfect for testing and building simple applications that require **CRUD** operations without needing a full backend server.

---

### **Steps to Set Up and Work with a JSON File**

#### **1. Create a JSON File**

First, create a `.json` file containing the data you want to work with. For this example, we'll create a `student.json` file with some sample student data.

1. **Create `student.json` File**: Inside your project directory, create a file called `student.json` and add the following content:
    

```json
{
  "student": [
    {
      "id": "1",
      "studname": "Rahul",
      "emailid": "rahul@gmail.com",
      "cellno": "987654321"
    },
    {
      "id": "2",
      "studname": "Meena",
      "emailid": "meena@gmail.com",
      "cellno": "987654351"
    },
    {
      "id": "3",
      "studname": "Ram",
      "emailid": "ram@gmail.com",
      "cellno": "987654348"
    },
    {
      "id": "4",
      "studname": "Vishal",
      "emailid": "vishal@gmail.com",
      "cellno": "987654314"
    },
    {
      "id": "5",
      "studname": "Sig",
      "emailid": "sig@gmail.com",
      "cellno": "987654345"
    }
  ]
}
```

This `student.json` file contains an array of student objects, each with an `id`, `studname`, `emailid`, and `cellno`.

#### **2. Install JSON Server**

Next, you need to install **JSON Server**. You can install it globally using npm:

1. **Open Terminal**: Open a terminal window or an integrated terminal in your code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code).
    
2. **Install JSON Server Globally**: Run the following command to install `json-server` globally on your system:
    
    ```bash
    npm install -g json-server
    ```
    
    This will make **JSON Server** available globally, so you can run it from anywhere in the terminal.
    

---

#### **3. Run the JSON File Using JSON Server**

Now that you have installed **JSON Server**, you can use it to serve your `student.json` file as a mock REST API.

1. **Run JSON Server**: In the terminal (make sure you're in the same directory as the `student.json` file), run the following command to start the server:
    
    ```bash
    json-server student.json
    ```
    
    This command starts a local server on port `3000` (by default) and serves the data as a RESTful API.
    
2. **Access the API**: Once the server is running, you can access the API at `http://localhost:3000`. You can interact with it using the following endpoints:
    
    - **GET all students**: `http://localhost:3000/student`
        
    - **GET a specific student by ID**: `http://localhost:3000/student/1` (replace `1` with the student's `id`).
        
    - **POST (Create) a new student**: `http://localhost:3000/student`
        
    - **PUT (Update) a student**: `http://localhost:3000/student/1` (replace `1` with the student's `id`).
        
    - **DELETE (Delete) a student**: `http://localhost:3000/student/1` (replace `1` with the student's `id`).
        

---

### **CRUD Operations Using JSON Server**

You can perform basic **CRUD** operations to interact with the data.

#### **C: Create (POST)**

To add a new student, send a **POST** request to the `/student` endpoint.

**Example Request:**

```json
POST /student
{
  "id": "6",
  "studname": "John",
  "emailid": "john@example.com",
  "cellno": "987654399"
}
```

This will add a new student with the specified `id`, `studname`, `emailid`, and `cellno`.

#### **R: Retrieve (GET)**

To retrieve student data, you can use **GET** requests.

**Example Requests:**

- **Get all students**:  
    `GET http://localhost:3000/student`
    
- **Get a specific student by ID**:  
    `GET http://localhost:3000/student/1` (Replace `1` with the desired `id`).
    

#### **U: Update (PUT)**

To update an existing student, send a **PUT** request with the updated data.

**Example Request:**

```json
PUT /student/1
{
  "id": "1",
  "studname": "Rahul Kumar",
  "emailid": "rahulkumar@gmail.com",
  "cellno": "987654310"
}
```

This will update the student with `id: 1` with the new details.

#### **D: Delete (DELETE)**

To delete a student, send a **DELETE** request to the `/student` endpoint with the student's `id`.

**Example Request:**

```bash
DELETE /student/1
```

This will delete the student with `id: 1`.

### **Additional Notes**

1. **Customizing JSON Server**:
    
    - You can customize the server behavior by adding a `json-server.json` file or passing command-line flags. For example, you can change the port or set custom routes.
        
2. **Watch Mode**:
    
    - If you want **JSON Server** to watch for changes in the `student.json` file and automatically reload the server, run the following command:
        
        ```bash
        json-server --watch student.json
        ```
        
    - This ensures that any changes made to the `student.json` file will automatically be reflected in the API.
        
3. **Advanced Querying**:
    
    - JSON Server supports query parameters to filter, sort, and paginate data.
        
    - **Sort by a field**:  
        `GET /student?_sort=studname&_order=asc` will return the students sorted by `studname` in ascending order.
        
    - **Pagination**:  
        `GET /student?_page=1&_limit=2` will return only two students on page 1.
        
4. **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)**:
    
    - If you're working with a frontend application (like React) that needs to interact with your **JSON Server** API, make sure to enable **CORS**. JSON Server has CORS support built in, so you don't need additional configuration in most cases.

### **Summary**:

With **JSON Server**, you can quickly create a mock REST API based on a JSON file, making it a perfect tool for testing, prototyping, and building simple applications. You can easily perform **CRUD** operations to manage your data, and the server is highly customizable. It’s a great tool to use during development when you don’t want to set up a full backend.
