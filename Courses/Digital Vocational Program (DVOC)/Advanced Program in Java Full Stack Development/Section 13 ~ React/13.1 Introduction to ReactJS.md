## What is ReactJS?

_ReactJS_ is a **declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library** for building user interfaces. It helps developers build reusable UI components, focusing only on the **view layer** of an application.

- **Open-source** and **component-based**.
    
- Initially created by **Jordan Walke**, a software engineer at **Facebook** in 2011, for Facebook's newsfeed section.
    
- Later, it was adopted by **WhatsApp** and is still maintained by **Meta** (formerly Facebook).

## PowerShell Script Execution Error (npm.ps1)

If you get an error like:

```
npm : File C:\Program Files\nodejs\npm.ps1 cannot be loaded because running scripts is disabled on this system.
```

It means PowerShell's execution policy is blocking script execution. You can fix it with one of the following methods:

### **Temporary Fix (For Current Session Only)**

Run this in **PowerShell as Administrator**:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
```

### **Permanent Fix (Recommended)**

Run this in **PowerShell as Administrator**:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```

### **Alternative Option**

Use **Command Prompt** (`cmd.exe`) instead of PowerShell to run your `npm` commands.

## How to Create a React Project?

1. Create a new React project using `create-react-app`:
    

```bash
create-react-app hello-react
```

In this case, `hello-react` is the name of your project.

2. To open the newly created React project in **Visual Studio Code**, run:
    

```bash
cd hello-react
code .
```

This will open the project folder in VS Code, and you can start coding your React application.
