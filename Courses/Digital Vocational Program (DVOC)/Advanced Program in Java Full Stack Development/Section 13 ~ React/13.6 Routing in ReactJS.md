## **React Routing Setup - Steps**

This guide walks you through setting up **React Router** in a React application to handle page navigation without page reloads.

### **1. Create a New React Project**:

First, create a new React project using the following command:

```bash
npx create-react-app routing-demo
```

This creates a new React application with the necessary files and folder structure.

### **2. Navigate to the Project Folder**:

Once the project is created, move into the project directory:

```bash
cd routing-demo
```

### **3. Install Dependencies**:

To enable routing in your React application, install `react-router-dom`:

```bash
npm install react-router-dom
```

- **`react-router-dom`**: This library allows you to add routing capabilities to your React app, enabling the navigation between different views (pages).
    

Optionally, you can also install `web-vitals` (which is included by default) to measure performance, but it's not necessary for the routing setup.

```bash
npm install web-vitals
```

### **4. Create Components for Different Pages**:

Inside the `src` folder, create components that will represent different pages/views of your app. These components will render content for different routes.

Create the following components:

- **Home.js**
    
- **AboutUs.js**
    
- **ContactUs.js**
    
- **Register.js**
    
- **Login.js**
    
- **PageNotFound.js** (404 page)
    

Below are the basic content for each of these components.

**`Home.js`**:

```js
import React from 'react';

function Home() {
  return <h2>Welcome to the Home Page!</h2>;
}

export default Home;
```

**`AboutUs.js`**:

```js
import React from 'react';

function AboutUs() {
  return <h2>Learn more About Us here!</h2>;
}

export default AboutUs;
```

**`ContactUs.js`**:

```js
import React from 'react';

function ContactUs() {
  return <h2>Contact Us for more information!</h2>;
}

export default ContactUs;
```

**`Register.js`**:

```js
import React from 'react';

function Register() {
  return <h2>Register to join us!</h2>;
}

export default Register;
```

**`Login.js`**:

```js
import React from 'react';

function Login() {
  return <h2>Login to your account!</h2>;
}

export default Login;
```

**`PageNotFound.js`**:

```js
import React from 'react';

function PageNotFound() {
  return <h2>404 - Page Not Found!</h2>;
}

export default PageNotFound;
```

### **5. Update `App.js` for Routing**:

Now, modify your `App.js` to handle the routing between the different pages.

Here’s the updated `App.js`:

```js
import './App.css';
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Routes, Link } from 'react-router-dom';
import Home from './Home';
import AboutUs from './AboutUs';
import ContactUs from './ContactUs';
import Login from './Login';
import Register from './Register';
import PageNotFound from './PageNotFound';

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <h1>React Routing Demo</h1>
      <hr />
      <Router>
        {/* Navigation Links */}
        <nav>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <Link to="/">Home</Link>
            </li>
            <li>
              <Link to="/AboutUs">About Us</Link>
            </li>
            <li>
              <Link to="/ContactUs">Contact Us</Link>
            </li>
            <li>
              <Link to="/Login">Login</Link>
            </li>
            <li>
              <Link to="/Register">Register</Link>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <hr />
        </nav>
        
        {/* Define Routes */}
        <Routes>
          <Route path="/" Component={Home} />
          <Route path="/AboutUs" Component={AboutUs} />
          <Route path="/ContactUs" Component={ContactUs} />
          <Route path="/Login" Component={Login} />
          <Route path="/Register" Component={Register} />
          <Route path="*" Component={PageNotFound} /> {/* Catch-all route */}
        </Routes>
      </Router>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

### **Explanation of the Code**:

1. **`<Router>`**: This is the wrapper component that enables routing functionality in the application. It's a context provider that allows you to navigate between different components based on the URL.
    
2. **`<nav>`**: Contains a list of **`<Link>`** components that function as navigation links between different routes.
    
    - `<Link>` is used for client-side navigation, so clicking the link doesn’t trigger a full page reload.
        
    - **`to`**: Specifies the path to navigate to (e.g., `/AboutUs` or `/ContactUs`).
        
3. **`<Routes>`**: This is where we define all the route mappings.
    
    - **`<Route>`** components map a URL path to a component.
        
    - **`path`** specifies the URL pattern.
        
    - **`Component`** specifies which component to render for the given route.
        
4. **Wildcard Route**:
    
    - The `*` route is a catch-all route. It matches any undefined route and renders the `PageNotFound` component. This is your **404 error page**.
        

### **How Routing Works**:

- When the user visits a URL like `/AboutUs`, the `AboutUs` component will be rendered.
    
- When they visit `/ContactUs`, the `ContactUs` component will be rendered.
    
- For any invalid URL, such as `/UnknownPage`, the `PageNotFound` component will be displayed.
    

### **6. Additional Notes**:

1. **`<Router>` vs `<BrowserRouter>`**:
    
    - **`BrowserRouter`** (aliased as `Router` in the code) is the most common routing method for React apps that are served over the web. It uses the HTML5 History API to manage the browser's history and URL.
        
2. **404 Handling**:
    
    - **Wildcard Route (`*`)**: The wildcard route ensures that if a user navigates to a URL that doesn't match any of the defined routes, the `PageNotFound` component will be displayed. This is a common pattern for handling 404 errors in React apps.
        
3. **Client-Side Routing**:
    
    - React Router uses **client-side routing**, meaning that the page doesn’t fully reload when navigating between different components. Instead, React renders only the components that need to be updated, making the navigation experience faster.
        
4. **Links vs `a` Tag**:
    
    - Use **`<Link>`** components from `react-router-dom` instead of traditional HTML `<a>` tags. The `<Link>` component handles navigation without triggering a page reload.
        

### **How to Test**:

1. **Start the Project**: After setting up your project, run the following to start the development server:
    
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    
2. **Test in the Browser**: Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000/`.
    
3. **Test Navigation**:
    
    - Click on the navigation links (e.g., Home, About Us, Contact Us, etc.) and observe that the page content changes without reloading.
        
    - Try navigating to an invalid route (e.g., `/NonExistentPage`) to see the **404 Page Not Found**.

### **Summary**:

By following these steps, you've successfully set up **React Router** in your application, allowing users to navigate between different pages without triggering a full page reload. You also have a custom **404 page** for any undefined routes. This is a key step in building a **single-page application (SPA)** in React.
