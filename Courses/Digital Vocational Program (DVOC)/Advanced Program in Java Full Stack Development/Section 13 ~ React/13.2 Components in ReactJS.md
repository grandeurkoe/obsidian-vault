## What is a component?

Components are the fundamental building blocks of React.

Any visual item in a user interface can be called a component.

A React component is a piece of JavaScript code that defines a portion of user interface.

A component is a part of the user interface, having a specific role.

A hierarchy of components is often called a component tree.

A form in a web page is a component.

A textbox inside a form is also a component.

So, a component may contain other components.

There are two types of components:-
1. Class components.
2. Functional components.

### Class Component Template

```React
import React from "react";
class Welcome extends React.Component {
	render() {
		<h1>Welcome to Class Component</h1>
	}
}

export default Welcome;
```
