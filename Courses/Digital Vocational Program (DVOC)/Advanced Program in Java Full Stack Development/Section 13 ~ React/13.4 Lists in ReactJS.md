## Using Lists in React

Lists are commonly used to display data in an ordered format, and they are often used to display menus or items on websites. In React, lists can be created using the `map()` function, which is commonly used for traversing and rendering elements dynamically.

### Using `map()` in React

The `map()` function in JavaScript is used to iterate over an array and apply a function to each element in the array. For example, if you want to multiply all the elements in an array by 5, you can use `map()`.

#### Example of `map()` Function:

```js
var numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const multiplyNums = numbers.map((number) => {
	return (number * 5);
});
console.log(multiplyNums);  // Output: [5, 10, 15, 20, 25]
```

- In the example above, the `map()` function iterates through the `numbers` array and multiplies each element by 5.

### Creating a Product List in React

Let's create a simple product list in React using the `map()` function to display the products dynamically.

#### Step 1: Create a `productList.js` Component

```js
// productList.js
import React from 'react';
import Product from './product';  // Import the Product component

function ProductList() {
  const products = [
    { code: 100, name: "Keyboard" },
    { code: 101, name: "Motherboard" },
  ];

  // Using map() to render each product item as a <Product> component
  const productComponents = products.map((product) => {
    return <Product key={product.code} item={product} />;
  });

  return <ul>{productComponents}</ul>;
}

export default ProductList;
```

#### Explanation:

- **`products` array** contains the list of products with `code` and `name`.
- The **`map()`** function is used to iterate through the products and create an array of `<Product />` components.
- The `key` attribute is added to each `<Product />` to help React efficiently update and render lists.
- The result is a `<ul>` containing `<li>` elements that represent each product.

---

#### Step 2: Create the `product.js` Component

```js
// product.js
import React from 'react';

function Product(props) {
  return (
    <li>
      {props.item.code} - {props.item.name}
    </li>
  );
}

export default Product;
```

#### Explanation:

- **`Product` component** takes `props` as an argument.
- It renders each product's `code` and `name` inside a `<li>` tag.

---

### How it Works:

1. The **`ProductList`** component creates a list of products and maps each product to a `<Product />` component.
2. The **`Product`** component receives the product details as `props` and displays the `code` and `name` inside an unordered list (`<ul>`).

---

### Key Concepts:

- The **`map()`** function is essential for dynamically rendering lists in React.
- Each item in a list should have a unique **`key`** to help React track and optimize re-rendering.
- React components can be broken down into smaller sub-components, which makes the code modular and easier to maintain.
