List are used to display data in an ordered format and mainly used to display menus on websites. 

Lists can be created in a similar way as we create lists in JavaScript.

The `map()` function is used for traversing the lists.

The `map()` function takes an array of numbers and multiply their values with 5.

```JS
var numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const multiplyNums = numbers.map((numbers) => {
	return (numbers * 5);
});
console.log(multiplyNums);
```
