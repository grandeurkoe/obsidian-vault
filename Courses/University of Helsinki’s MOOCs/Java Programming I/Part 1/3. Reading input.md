Input refers to text written by the user read by the program. Input is always read as a string. For reading input, we use the `Scanner` tool that comes with Java. The tool can be imported for use in a program by adding the command `import java.util.Scanner;` before the beginning of the main program's frame (`public class` ...). The tool itself is created with `Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);`.

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Program {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        // We can now use the scanner tool.
        // This tool is used to read input.
    }
}
```

Below is an example of a program which asks for user input, reads the string entered by the user, and then prints it.

```java
// Introduce the scanner tool used for reading user input
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Program {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a tool for reading user input and name it scanner
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        // Print "Write a message: "
        System.out.println("Write a message: ");

        // Read the string written by the user, and assign it
        // to program memory "String message = (string that was given as input)"
        String message = scanner.nextLine();

        // Print the message written by the user
        System.out.println(message);
    }
}
```

More precisely, input is read with the `scanner` tool's `nextLine()` method. The call `scanner.nextLine()` is left waiting for the user to write something. When user writes something and presses enter, the provided string is assigned to a **string variable** (in this instance `message`). The program is then able to reference the variable `message` later on â€” in the example above, the variable `message` is referenced in the print command.
