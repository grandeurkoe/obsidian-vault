## Program Boilerplate

In Java, our programs have to include some boilerplate code to function. This boilerplate, an example of which is shown below, for example tells the computer what your program is called. Below, the name of the program is `Example`. This name has to correspond to the name of the file that contains the source code (e.g. `Example.java`).

```java
public class Example {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
		// Write your program here
        System.out.println("Text to be printed");
    }
}
```

Execution of the program starts from the line that follows `public static void main(string[] args) {`, and ends at the closing curly bracket `}`. Commands are executed one line at a time.
