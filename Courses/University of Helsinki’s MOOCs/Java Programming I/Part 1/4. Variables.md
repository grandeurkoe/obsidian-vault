A variable can be thought of as a container in which information of a given type can be stored. Examples of these different types include text (`String`), whole numbers (`int`), floating-point numbers (`double`), and whether something is true or false (`boolean`). A value is assigned to a variable using the equals sign (`=`).

```java
int months = 12;
```

In the statement above, the value of 12 is assigned to an integer variable called months. The statement could be read as: "the variable months is assigned the value 12".

A variable's value can be joined to a string using the + sign, as seen in the following example.

```java
String text = "contains text";
int wholeNumber = 123;
double floatingPoint = 3.141592653;
boolean trueOrFalse = true;

System.out.println("Text variable: " + text);
System.out.println("Integer variable: " + wholeNumber);
System.out.println("Floating-point variable: " + floatingPoint);
System.out.println("Boolean: " + trueOrFalse);
```

Output:

Sample output

Text variable: contains text Integer variable: 123 Floating-point variable: 3.141592653 Booolean: true
