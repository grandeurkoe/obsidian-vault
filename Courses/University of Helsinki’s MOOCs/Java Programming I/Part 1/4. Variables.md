A variable can be thought of as a container in which information of a given type can be stored. Examples of these different types include text (`String`), whole numbers (`int`), floating-point numbers (`double`), and whether something is true or false (`boolean`). A value is assigned to a variable using the equals sign (`=`).

```java
int months = 12;
```

In the statement above, the value of 12 is assigned to an integer variable called months. The statement could be read as: "the variable months is assigned the value 12".

A variable's value can be joined to a string using the + sign, as seen in the following example.

```java
String text = "contains text";
int wholeNumber = 123;
double floatingPoint = 3.141592653;
boolean trueOrFalse = true;

System.out.println("Text variable: " + text);
System.out.println("Integer variable: " + wholeNumber);
System.out.println("Floating-point variable: " + floatingPoint);
System.out.println("Boolean: " + trueOrFalse);
```

Output:

```Output
Text variable: contains text 
Integer variable: 123 
Floating-point variable: 3.141592653 
Booolean: true
```

Variable names are unique - no two variables can have the same name. The program in the following example is faulty as it attempts to create the variable `pi` twice. The variable is created the first time its declared.

```java
public class Example {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        double pi = 3.14;
        double pi = 3.141592653;

        System.out.println("The value of pi is: " + pi);
    }
}
```

The variable type is stated when the variable is first declared. When a new value is assigned to the variable, the type is no longer declared.

```java
int value = 10;
System.out.println(value);
value = 4;
System.out.println(value);
```

```Output
10
4
```

## Changing a Value Assigned to a Variable

A variable exists from the moment of its declaration, and its initial value is preserved until another value is assigned to it. You can change a variable's value using a statement that comprises the variable name, an equals sign, and the new value to be assigned. Remember to keep in mind that the variable type is only stated during the initial variable declaration.

```java
int number = 123;
System.out.println("The value of the variable is " + number);

number = 42;
System.out.println("The value of the variable is " + number);
```

Output:

```Output
The value of the variable is 123 
The value of the variable is 42
```
