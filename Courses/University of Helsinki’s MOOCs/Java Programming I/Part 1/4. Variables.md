A variable can be thought of as a container in which information of a given type can be stored. Examples of these different types include text (`String`), whole numbers (`int`), floating-point numbers (`double`), and whether something is true or false (`boolean`). A value is assigned to a variable using the equals sign (`=`).

```java
int months = 12;
```

In the statement above, the value of 12 is assigned to an integer variable called months. The statement could be read as: "the variable months is assigned the value 12".

A variable's value can be joined to a string using the + sign, as seen in the following example.

```java
String text = "contains text";
int wholeNumber = 123;
double floatingPoint = 3.141592653;
boolean trueOrFalse = true;

System.out.println("Text variable: " + text);
System.out.println("Integer variable: " + wholeNumber);
System.out.println("Floating-point variable: " + floatingPoint);
System.out.println("Boolean: " + trueOrFalse);
```

Output:

```Output
Text variable: contains text 
Integer variable: 123 
Floating-point variable: 3.141592653 
Booolean: true
```

Variable names are unique - no two variables can have the same name. The program in the following example is faulty as it attempts to create the variable `pi` twice. The variable is created the first time its declared.

```java
public class Example {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        double pi = 3.14;
        double pi = 3.141592653;

        System.out.println("The value of pi is: " + pi);
    }
}
```

The variable type is stated when the variable is first declared. When a new value is assigned to the variable, the type is no longer declared.

```java
int value = 10;
System.out.println(value);
value = 4;
System.out.println(value);
```

```Output
10
4
```

## Changing a Value Assigned to a Variable

A variable exists from the moment of its declaration, and its initial value is preserved until another value is assigned to it. You can change a variable's value using a statement that comprises the variable name, an equals sign, and the new value to be assigned. Remember to keep in mind that the variable type is only stated during the initial variable declaration.

```java
int number = 123;
System.out.println("The value of the variable is " + number);

number = 42;
System.out.println("The value of the variable is " + number);
```

Output:

```Output
The value of the variable is 123 
The value of the variable is 42
```

Let's look at the preceding program's execution step-by-step. When a variable appears in the program for the first time, i.e., the computer is told both its type (in this case `int`) and its name (in this case `number`), the computer creates a 'named container' for the variable. Then, the value on the right side of the equals sign is copied into this named container.

Whenever a variable is referenced by its name in a program — here, we want to print the string "The value of the variable is " followed by the value of the `number` variable — its value is retrieved from a container that has the corresponding name.

  [![part1 4 variable change 2](https://java-programming.mooc.fi/static/25ba03785d689549fc796ace09039d6b/f96df/part1.4-variable-change-2.png "part1 4 variable change 2")](https://java-programming.mooc.fi/static/25ba03785d689549fc796ace09039d6b/f96df/part1.4-variable-change-2.png)

Whenever a value is assigned to a variable (here `number = 42`), a check is run to see whether a container with the given name already exists. If one does, a new value is copied in the place of the old value, and the old value disappears. If a container of the variable name is not found, the program execution ends in an error message, or it fails to run.

The variable is then referenced again by its name in the program — we again want to print the string "The value of the variable is " followed by the value of the `number` variable. We proceed as normal, retrieving the value of `number` from a container having its name.

  [![part1 4 variable change 4](https://java-programming.mooc.fi/static/e922d7faaeb7fea6f74b76cf6363d5d5/f96df/part1.4-variable-change-4.png "part1 4 variable change 4")](https://java-programming.mooc.fi/static/e922d7faaeb7fea6f74b76cf6363d5d5/f96df/part1.4-variable-change-4.png)

At the end of the program, you'll notice that the original value of the variable has vanished. A variable can hold only one value at a time.

## Variable's Type Persists

Once a variable's type has been declared, it can no longer be changed. For example, a boolean value cannot be assigned to a variable of the integer type, nor can an integer be assigned to a variable of the boolean type.

```java
boolean integerAssignmentWillWork = false;
integerAssignmentWillWork = 42; // Does not work

int value = 10;
integerAssignmentWillWork = value; // Neither does this
```

However, exceptions do exist: an integer can be assigned to a variable of the double type, since Java knows how to convert an integer to a double during assignment.

```java
double floatingPoint = 0.42;
floatingPoint = 1; // Works

int value = 10;
floatingPoint = value; // Also works
```

A floating-point value cannot, however, be assigned to an integer variable. The reason for this is that those who develop the language aim to prevent developers from making errors that lead to a loss of information.

```java
int value = 4.2; // Does not work

double floatingPoint = 0.42;
value = floatingPoint; // Neither does this
```

## Naming Variables

Naming variables is a fundamental aspect of describing a program. Let's look at two examples.

```java
double a = 3.14;
double b = 22.0;
double c = a * b * b;

System.out.println(c);
```

Sample output

1519.76

```java
double pi = 3.14;
double radius = 22.0;
double surfaceArea = pi * radius * radius;

System.out.println(surfaceArea);
```

```Output
1519.76
```

Both of the preceding examples function the same way and output the same result. One of them is, however, much more understandable. The objective here is to compute the surface area of a circle. The value of pi is defined in the first row, the circle's radius in the second, and the surface area calculated in the third.

Variable naming is limited by certain constraints.

Variable names cannot contain certain special symbols, such as exclamation marks (!). Spaces are also not allowed, since they're used to separate parts of commands. Instead of spaces, the convention in Java is to use a style known as [camelCase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case "Camel case – Wikipedia"). **Note!** The first letter of a variable name is always lower-cased:

```java
int camelCaseVariable = 7;
```

Numbers can be used within a variable name as long as the name does not begin with a number. Also, a name cannot consists of numbers only.

```java
int 7variable = 4; // Not allowed!
int variable7 = 4; // Allowed, but is not a descriptive variable name
```

A variable's name cannot already be in use. These names include, for instance, variables previously defined in the program and commands provided by Java, such as `System.out.print` and `System.out.println`. —>

```java
int System.out.print = 4; // Not Allowed!
int System.out.println = 4; // Not Allowed!
```

```java
int camelCase = 2;
int camelCase = 5; // Not allowed -- camelCase variable is already in use!
```

Letters containing diacritics (e.g. the letters ä and ö used in Finnish) should also not be used in variable names. You can replace these letters with their non-diacritic equivalents. For example, you should convert ä -> a and ö -> o.

### Permissible Variable Names

- lastDayOfMonth = 20
- firstYear = 1952
- name = "Essi"

### Impermissible Variable Names

- last day of month = 20
- 1day = 1952
- beware! = 1910
- 1920 = 1
