## Programmers Write Source Code

Programming is designing and implementing software. The functionality is implemented based on the wishes and requirements of the users and the customers. Programs are typically implemented (i.e., written or "coded") in a programming language meant to be written and read by humans.

The "code" you write is called **source code**. Source code consists of statements and expressions, which are read line by line from top to bottom, and from left to right. 

For example, to print "Hello world", you can use the pre-defined Java command `System.out.println()`, to which you need to provide the text inside the parentheses that you'd like to be printed:

```java
System.out.println("Hello World");
```

The above statement is pre-built into Java, and it's used for printing a string. The statement tells the computer to output the string that's been provided to it, placed between the quotation marks. The statement ends with a semicolon `;`.
