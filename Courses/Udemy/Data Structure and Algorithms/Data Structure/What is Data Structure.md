# What is Data Structure?

Data Structure is a collection of values.

A data structure is not only used for organizing the data. It is also used for storing, processing and retrieving data. There are different basic and advanced types of data structures that are used in almost every program or software system that has been developed. So we must have good knowledge about data structures.

## Classification of Data Structure

### Linear Data Structure

Data structure in which data elements are arranged sequentially or linearly, where each element is attached to its previous and next adjacent elements, is called a linear data structure.   

Examples of linear data structures are array, stack, queue, linked list, etc.

- Static data structure: Static data structure has a fixed memory size. It is easier to access the elements in a static data structure. An example of this data structure is an array.
- Dynamic data structure: In dynamic data structure, the size is not fixed. It can be randomly updated during the runtime which may be considered efficient concerning the memory (space) complexity of the code. Examples of this data structure are queue, stack, etc.

### Non-linear Data Structure

Data structures where data elements are not placed sequentially or linearly are called non-linear data structures. In a non-linear data structure, we can’t traverse all the elements in a single run only.   

Examples of non-linear data structures are trees and graphs.

# **What is Data Structure?**

A **Data Structure** is a collection of values, and the way these values are organized, stored, and manipulated. It is essential for efficiently managing and processing data in software systems. Data structures are not just about storing data; they also provide mechanisms for efficiently performing operations such as storing, retrieving, and modifying data.

Understanding data structures is crucial because they help in:

- **Efficient data storage**
    
- **Fast data retrieval**
    
- **Optimized memory usage**
    
- **Effective processing of information**
    

Every software system, whether simple or complex, relies on data structures for organizing data and handling different operations in an optimal manner. Therefore, mastering data structures is fundamental for writing efficient and scalable code.

## **Classification of Data Structures**

### **1. Linear Data Structures**

In **linear data structures**, data elements are arranged sequentially, where each element is connected to the one before and after it, forming a straight line. In these structures, elements can be accessed in a single pass (i.e., traversal is linear).

#### **Examples of Linear Data Structures**:

- **Array**: A collection of elements of the same type stored in contiguous memory locations.
    
- **Stack**: A collection of elements that follows the **Last In, First Out** (LIFO) principle, where the most recently added element is the first to be removed.
    
- **Queue**: A collection of elements that follows the **First In, First Out** (FIFO) principle, where the first element added is the first to be removed.
    
- **Linked List**: A collection of nodes, where each node contains data and a reference (or link) to the next node in the sequence.
    

#### **Types of Linear Data Structures**:

- **Static Data Structures**: These data structures have a fixed size determined at compile time. Elements can be accessed randomly. **Arrays** are an example of a static data structure.
    
- **Dynamic Data Structures**: These data structures do not have a fixed size and can grow or shrink during runtime, offering flexibility in memory usage. **Stacks** and **Queues** are examples of dynamic data structures.

### **2. Non-linear Data Structures**

In **non-linear data structures**, elements are not arranged sequentially. Instead, they have a hierarchical or graph-based relationship where each element can have multiple connections to other elements. These structures are more complex than linear data structures and require specialized algorithms for traversal.

#### **Examples of Non-linear Data Structures**:

- **Trees**: A hierarchical structure where each node has a parent-child relationship with other nodes. A **Binary Tree** is a common example, where each node has at most two children.
    
- **Graphs**: A collection of nodes (also called vertices) connected by edges, where the connections between nodes may or may not follow a hierarchy.
    

Non-linear data structures are used to represent relationships between data elements in more complex ways than linear data structures.

|**Type**|**Description**|**Examples**|
|---|---|---|
|**Linear Data Structures**|Elements arranged sequentially with direct access to neighbors.|Array, Stack, Queue, Linked List|
|**Static Linear Data**|Data structures with a fixed size that can be accessed directly.|Array|
|**Dynamic Linear Data**|Data structures whose size can change during runtime.|Stack, Queue|
|**Non-linear Data Structures**|Data elements have complex relationships, not sequential.|Trees, Graphs|

## **Conclusion**

Understanding the different types of data structures—linear and non-linear—is key to solving a wide range of problems in computer science and software development. By using the right data structure, you can optimize the performance of algorithms and ensure efficient data processing.
