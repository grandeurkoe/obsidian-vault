### **What are Algorithms?**

- **Definition**: Algorithms are step-by-step procedures or formulas used to solve specific problems or perform tasks.
    
- **Purpose**: They provide a systematic approach to solving complex problems efficiently and effectively.
    
- **Key Features**:
    
    - **Clear Instructions**: Each step is well-defined and unambiguous.
        
    - **Finiteness**: An algorithm must always terminate after a finite number of steps.
        
    - **Input and Output**: Algorithms may take inputs and produce outputs.
        
    - **Deterministic**: Given the same input, an algorithm will always produce the same output.
        
    - **Effectiveness**: All steps must be basic enough to be carried out in a finite amount of time and with available resources.

### **Types of Algorithms**:

1. **Sorting Algorithms**: Arrange data in a particular order (e.g., Bubble Sort, Quick Sort).
    
2. **Search Algorithms**: Find specific data within a dataset (e.g., Binary Search, Linear Search).
    
3. **Graph Algorithms**: Solve problems related to networks or graphs (e.g., Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm, Depth-First Search).
    
4. **Dynamic Programming Algorithms**: Break down complex problems into simpler subproblems (e.g., Fibonacci Sequence).
    
5. **Greedy Algorithms**: Make optimal choices at each step to find the best solution (e.g., Knapsack Problem).
    
6. **Divide and Conquer Algorithms**: Divide a problem into smaller subproblems and solve them individually (e.g., Merge Sort).
