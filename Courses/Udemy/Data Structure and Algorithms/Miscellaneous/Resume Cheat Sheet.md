# **Resume Cheat Sheet**

Creating a resume that stands out is essential in the job application process. Follow these tips to ensure that your resume is well-structured, concise, and impactful:

### **1. Use a Pre-designed Resume Template**

- Pick a clean, professional template that’s easy to read and looks polished.
    
- Templates can help you avoid formatting issues and save time.

### **2. Make the Resume Fit on 1 Page**

- Keep it concise. Employers spend very little time scanning resumes, so aim to highlight the most important information on one page.

### **3. Include Words from the Job Description**

- Tailor your resume to the specific role. Incorporate keywords from the job description to show that you align with the role and to pass through Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS).

### **4. Include the Company Name You Are Applying To**

- Customizing your resume by including the company name shows you're targeting your application specifically to them.

### **5. Does Your First Item on Your Resume Reflect What They Are Looking For?**

- The first item should quickly convey that you possess the skills and experience the employer is looking for.

### **6. Experience Titles Demonstrate Value**

- Use titles that reflect the value you've brought in each position, not just your job duties. For example, instead of "Software Engineer," use "Software Engineer: Improved System Efficiency by 25%."

### **7. Do You Have an Online Link?**

- Include links to your online portfolio, LinkedIn, GitHub, or personal website. This is especially important for those in technical or creative fields.

### **8. Remove the Word “I”**

- Avoid using "I" in your resume. It’s understood that the resume is about you. Keep the sentences short and to the point.

### **9. No Buzzwords Describing How Great You Are**

- Skip overused terms like “hardworking,” “team player,” or “dynamic.” Instead, show what you’ve achieved.
    

### **10. Are You Using Action Words?**

- Use strong action verbs to describe your achievements. For example: "Led," "Developed," "Improved," "Created," "Initiated," etc.
    

### **11. Measure Everything in Terms of Impact**

- Quantify your impact. Instead of listing responsibilities, show how your actions led to measurable results. For example: "Increased sales by 20% in the first quarter."
    

### **12. Technical Knowledge/Skills Should Include What They Are Looking For**

- Make sure to list skills that are relevant to the job you’re applying for. Don’t include unnecessary details unless it’s impressive or directly related to the role. For example, instead of just listing programming languages, specify your proficiency (e.g., "Python – 3 years").
    

### **13. Include Only Sections/Items That Are Impressive:**

- **Experience:** Focus on relevant roles and achievements.
    
- **Projects:** Include significant projects that demonstrate your skills.
    
- **Education:** Only list relevant degrees or certifications.
    
- **Technical Skills:** Include hard skills that are specific to the job you're applying for.
    

### **14. No Typos or Bad Grammar**

- Always proofread your resume. Typos or poor grammar can leave a bad impression on hiring managers. Consider using tools like Grammarly or getting a second opinion before submitting.
    

By following these guidelines, you’ll create a focused, compelling resume that effectively showcases your qualifications.
