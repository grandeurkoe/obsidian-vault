### **What is Big O?**

Big O, also known as **Asymptotic Analysis**, is a way of describing the performance or complexity of an algorithm. It helps in understanding how the algorithm will scale as the size of the input grows.

Good code is not only readable but also **scalable** — meaning it handles both **speed (time complexity)** and **memory (space complexity)** efficiently.

Big O notation specifically focuses on **how long it takes for an algorithm to execute** relative to the size of the input.

It describes the **worst-case scenario** or the **maximum amount of resources (time or space)** an algorithm might use, regardless of how the input changes. It sets an **upper limit** on the growth rate, ensuring that the algorithm's performance will not exceed the described complexity.

### **Common Big O Notations**

#### **O(1) - Constant Time**

- **Description**: The algorithm's performance is constant, meaning it takes the same time regardless of the size of the input.
    
- **Example**: Accessing an element in an array by index.
    
- **When it occurs**: No loops or recursive calls.
    
- **Complexity**: **Good complexity** because it doesn’t depend on input size.
    
- **Real-life Example**: Checking if a number is odd or even.
    

#### **O(log n) - Logarithmic Time**

- **Description**: The algorithm's performance grows logarithmically with the size of the input. This often happens when the input is reduced by half with each step (e.g., in binary search).
    
- **Example**: Binary Search (on a sorted list).
    
- **When it occurs**: Algorithms that repeatedly divide the input in half.
    
- **Complexity**: **Good complexity** because it grows very slowly as the input size increases.
    
- **Real-life Example**: Searching in a sorted array (binary search).
    

#### **O(n) - Linear Time**

- **Description**: The algorithm’s performance grows directly in proportion to the input size. As the number of inputs increases, the operations increase linearly.
    
- **Example**: Looping through each element in an array or list.
    
- **When it occurs**: Algorithms with a single loop or recursion over all input items.
    
- **Complexity**: **Fair complexity** because it scales with input size.
    
- **Real-life Example**: Finding the maximum value in an unsorted array.
    

#### **O(n log n) - Linearithmic Time**

- **Description**: This is a combination of linear and logarithmic growth. Common in efficient sorting algorithms.
    
- **Example**: Merge Sort, Heap Sort.
    
- **When it occurs**: Often in algorithms that divide the data and perform a linear operation on each division.
    
- **Complexity**: **Bad time complexity**, but still relatively efficient for large datasets.
    
- **Real-life Example**: Sorting large datasets efficiently.
    

#### **O(n²) - Quadratic Time**

- **Description**: The algorithm’s performance is proportional to the square of the input size. This typically happens in algorithms with nested loops.
    
- **Example**: Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort.
    
- **When it occurs**: Algorithms with nested loops or recursive calls that iterate over all combinations of input.
    
- **Complexity**: **Horrible complexity** because performance degrades rapidly as the input size grows.
    
- **Real-life Example**: Comparing every pair of elements in an array.
    

#### **O(2ⁿ) - Exponential Time**

- **Description**: The algorithm’s performance doubles with each additional element in the input. This is common in recursive algorithms that solve a problem by dividing it into multiple smaller subproblems.
    
- **Example**: Solving the Travelling Salesman Problem (Brute Force).
    
- **When it occurs**: Often in recursive algorithms that try all possibilities for each input.
    
- **Complexity**: **Horrible complexity**, as the performance becomes infeasible for large inputs.
    
- **Real-life Example**: Certain recursive algorithms for solving combinatorial problems.
    

#### **O(n!) - Factorial Time**

- **Description**: The algorithm’s performance grows factorially with the size of the input. This typically happens in algorithms that have nested loops where each loop depends on the size of the input.
    
- **Example**: Solving the Travelling Salesman Problem (Brute Force with all possible permutations).
    
- **When it occurs**: Algorithms that generate all permutations or combinations of input.
    
- **Complexity**: **Horrible complexity**, often the result of a poorly optimized solution.
    
- **Real-life Example**: Finding all permutations of a string.
