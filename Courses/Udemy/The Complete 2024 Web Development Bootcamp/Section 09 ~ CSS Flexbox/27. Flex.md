**Flexbox** is designed specifically for creating an overall page structure.

For example,
```html
<div class = "container">
	<div class="one"><p>...</p></div>
	<div class="two"><p>...</p></div>
	<div class="three"><p>...</p></div>
</div>
```

```css
.container {
	display: flex;
	gap: 10px;
}
```

In flexbox, we enclose all the elements that you want to display inside a flexible container, then the display values for the elements within the container will be ignored. Width of each elements is based on the content size.

`display: flex` will create a flexible container, that is a `block` element, with width set to 100%.

`display: inline-flex` will create a flexible container, that allows the container to occupy as much space as needed. Other elements can also occupy remaining space because it is also inline.
