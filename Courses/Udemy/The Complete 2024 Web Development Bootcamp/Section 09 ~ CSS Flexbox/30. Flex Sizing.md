Sizing for each flex item is worked out on the basis of a priority list.

*Content width < Width < flex-basis < min-width/max-width

`max-width` looks at the longest possible line of text.

`min-width` looks at the longest possible word.

We can set the width of the flex item like this:

```css
.flex-item {
	width: 100px;
}
```

Here,
- The CSS rule of `width: 100px;` will be respected until we have enough space in the overall container.
- Otherwise, it will ignore the rule and set the size to the longest possible word.

```css
.flex-item {
	width: 100px;
	flex-basis: 200px;
}
```

Here,
- In the presence of the `flex-basis` the `width` property will be ignored.
