Sizing for each flex item is worked out on the basis of a priority list.

*Content width < Width < flex-basis < min-width/max-width

`max-width` looks at the longest possible line of text.

`min-width` looks at the longest possible word.

## `width`

We can set the width of the flex item like this:

```css
.flex-item {
	width: 100px;
}
```

Here,
- The CSS rule of `width: 100px;` will be respected until we have enough space in the overall container.
- Otherwise, it will ignore the rule and set the size to the longest possible word.

## `flex-basis`

```css
.flex-item {
	width: 100px; <!-- No point in setting this because it will be ignored -->
	flex-basis: 200px;
}
```

Here,
- In the presence of the `flex-basis` the `width` property will be ignored.

## `min-width/max-width`

```css
.flex-item {
	flex-basis: 200px; 
	max-width: 100px;
}
```

Here,
- In the presence of `max-width`, the one with the lower value would used to assign size for the flex elements.
- `max-width` determines the growth potential of each flex item.
- `min-width` determine the shrink potential of each flex item
-  In the presence of `min-width`, if the `min-width` is larger then the `flex-basis` then it will respect that CSS rule.

## Grow and Shrink

To turn off the `flex-grow` property set `flex-grow: 0` and to turn off the `flex-shrink` property set `flex-shrink: 0`.

To turn on the `flex-grow` or the `flex-shrink` property, simply set their values to 1.

```css
flex.item {
	flex-basis: 100px;
	flex-grow: 1;
	flex-shrink: 0;
}
```

Here,
- `flex-grow` is turned on and `flex-shrink` is turned off.
- Since the `flex-grow` property is set to on, the flex items are allowed to grow and since there is plenty of space to grow, thereâ€™s way more than 400px to fit out fout items, then it
