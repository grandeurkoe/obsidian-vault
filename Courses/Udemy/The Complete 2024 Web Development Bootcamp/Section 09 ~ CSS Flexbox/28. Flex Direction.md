By default, `flex-direction` property is set to row. This is the reason why the elements within the flexible container are arranged one after another from left to right in a row.

When your setting `flex-direction`, you’re setting something called the **main-axis**.

**Cross-axis** goes perpendicular to the main-axis.

When `flex-direction` is row, then main-axis is horizontal from left to right and cross-axis is vertical from top to bottom.

When `flex-direction` is column, then main-axis is vertical from top to bottom and cross-axis is horizontal from left to right.

Along with `flex-basis` and a number of properties, essentially they are flexing along the main axis. When the main-axis is horizontal, the flex-basis will set the width and when it’s a column, the flex-basis will set the height.

`flex-basis` is set on the elements within the container.
