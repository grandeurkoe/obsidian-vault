It is important to differentiate which flex property is applied to flex items and which ones are applied to the flex container.

`order` property is applied to flex items. It allows us to set the order in which the flex items will appear.

By default `order` property is set to 0. The flex items will appear in the order in which they are written in the HTML file.
