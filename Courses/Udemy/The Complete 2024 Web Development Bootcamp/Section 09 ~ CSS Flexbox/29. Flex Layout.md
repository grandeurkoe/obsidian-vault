It is important to differentiate which flex property is applied to flex items and which ones are applied to the flex container.

## `order`  property

`order` property is applied to flex items. It allows us to set the order in which the flex items will appear.

By default `order` property is set to 0. The flex items will appear in the order in which they are written in the HTML file.

## `flex-wrap` property

This is useful when you run out of space in the horizontal.

For example,
```css
.container {
	flex-wrap: nowrap;
}
```

Here,
- If there is no more space, then the flex item will not be pushed to the next line.
- This is the default behavior of Flexbox.
- If you want the flex items to be pushed onto the next line when no more space is available, then set `flex-wrap: wrap`.
- `flex-wrap: wrap-reverse` will wrap the flex items in reverse from bottom to top.

## `justify-content` property

This property is set on the parent container.

It sets the distribution of items along the main-axis.

For example,
```css
.container {
	justify-content: flex-start;
}
```

Here,
- If set to `flex-start`, everything will be bunched up to the left.
- If set to `flex-end`, everything will be bunched up at the end.
- If set to `center`, everything will be bunched up at the center.
- If set to `space-between`, everything will be bunched up at the end.
