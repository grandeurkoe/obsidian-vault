The internet is a long piece of wire. This wire connects different computers to each other. 

Data can be transferred between computers through this giant wire.

Some of these computers attached to the internet have a very special job, they have to be online 24/7, ready to serve you all the data and files that you are requesting when you are trying to access a website, and these are called *servers*.

Any computer that a user would use to access the Internet is called a *client*.

A *Web Server* is a giant library that is open 24/7.

## How  do you locate your website in the web server?

Let’s say you want to access `www.google.com`.

What happens behind the scenes:
1. Your browser will send that message to your ISP (Internet Service Provider). ISPs are the people that you pay to be able to access the internet.
2. The ISP will they relay the message to the DNS (Domain Name System) Server. A DNS Server is essentially a souped-up phone book. The DNS server will look up in its database to find the exact IP address of the website that you’re trying to access. Every single computer that is connected to the internet has an IP address. You can use IP addresses to contact other computers that are connected to the internet.
3. Once the DNS server finds that IP address, it will send it back to your browser through the ISP, over the internet.
4. You can then make a direct request to that address. What lives at that IP address is of course the Google servers, and they’ll be able to send you back all the files and data you need to able to view the Google homepage.
