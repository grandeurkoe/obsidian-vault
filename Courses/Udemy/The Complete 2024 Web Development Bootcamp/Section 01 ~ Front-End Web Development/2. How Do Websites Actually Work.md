The data that you receive from the server usually consists of three types of files:
1. **HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)** - Responsible for the content and the structure of your website.
2. **CSS (Cascading Style Sheet)** - Responsible for styling your website.
3. **JavaScript** - Responsible for adding functionality to your website.

A *web browser* is a piece of software that specializes in dealing with these files.
