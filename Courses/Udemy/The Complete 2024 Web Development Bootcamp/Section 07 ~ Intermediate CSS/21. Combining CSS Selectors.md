Here, we will combine selectors to select a specific element.

For example,
```css
p {
	color: yellow;
}
.inner-box p {
	color:white;
}
```

Here,
- Set `color` as white for all `p` element descendants of `inner-box` class.

## Different ways you can combine CSS selectors

### Group rule

Done using comma (,). To separate selectors, we use comma.

For example,
```css
selector, selector {
	color: blueviolet;
}
```

Here,
- CSS rule will be applied to both the selectors.
