There are four different values for the `position` property:
- Static
- Relative
- Absolute
- Fixed

## Static Positioning

By default, every element has **static** positioning.

This means that each item flows as they would in our HTML.

For example,
```css
div {
	position: static;
	left: 50px;
	top: 50px;
}
```

## Relative position

In relative position, the item gets positioned relative to its default position.

For example,
```css
div {
	position: relative;
	left: 50px;
	top: 50px;
}
```

Here,
- `div` element will be pushed 50px to the left and 50px from the top.
