Cascading is helpful when there are multiple different conflicting CSS rules.

Among the conflicting rules, the one that is higher in the hierarchy will be applied.

There are four broad categories which we look at when determining the overall level of importance:
- [[#Position]]
- [[#Specificity]]
- [[#Type]]
- [[#Importance]]

## Position

For example,
```css
li {
	color: red;
	color: blue;
}
```

Here,
- Here the second CSS rule will override the first CSS rule.
- The lower down the CSS rule is, the higher its importance.

## Specificity

**CSS specificity** refers to how specific a selector is in terms of the element that youâ€™re applying the CSS rule to.

For example,
```css
li {color: blue;}
.first-class {color:red;}
li[draggable] {color:purple;}
#first-id {color:orange;}
```

Level of importance (highest first):
1. ID Selector
2. Attribute Selector
3. Class Selector
4. Element Selector

## Type

There are three different ways you can applying styling to your website:
- Inline CSS
- Internal CSS
- External CSS

Level of importance (highest first):
1. Inline CSS.
2. Internal CSS.
3. External CSS.

## Importance

For example,
```css
li {
	color: red;
	color: blue !important;
}
```

Here,
- Using `!important` keyword will make this rule the most important rule relative to that el
