Paragraph element takes up the entire full width of the webpage.

Span element doesn’t take up the entire full width of the webpage.

For example,
```html
<h2>Harry</h2>
<h2>Potter</h2>
```

```css
h2 {
	display:inline;
}
```

```output
Harry Potter
```

For span, the `display` property is set to `inline`.

You can’t set the `width` and `height` of an inline element. The size of the inline element will default to the size of their content.

By default, most element have the `display` property set to `block`. These elements will occupy the full width of the webpage.

In `inline-block`, you can set the `width` and `height` of the element and position the element on the same line as well.

When you set the `display` property to `none`. It will make the element disappear.
