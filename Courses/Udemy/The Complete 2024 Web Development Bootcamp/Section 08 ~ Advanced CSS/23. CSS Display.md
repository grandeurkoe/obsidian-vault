Paragraph element takes up the entire full width of the webpage.

Span element doesnâ€™t take up the entire full width of the webpage.

For example,
```html
<h2>Harry</h2>
<h2>Potter</h2>
```

```css
h2 {
	display:inline;
}
```

```output
Harry Potter
```

For span, the `display` property is set to `inline`.

By default, most element have the `display` property set to `block`. These elements will occupy the full width of the webpage.
