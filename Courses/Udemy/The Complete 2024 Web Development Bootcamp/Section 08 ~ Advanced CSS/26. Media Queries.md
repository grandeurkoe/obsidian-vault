```css
@media (max-width: 600px) {
	h2 {
		font-size: 15px;
	}
}
```

Here,
- Replace CSS selectors with `@media`.
- The content inside the set of round braces is the `breakpoint`. This essentially says that at this particular width, anything less than or equal to 600px, apply the styling defined inside the media query.
