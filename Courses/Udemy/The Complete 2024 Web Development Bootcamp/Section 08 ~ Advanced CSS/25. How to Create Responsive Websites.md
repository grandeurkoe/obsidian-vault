We need to make our website responsive, so it responds to the changes in the screen size.

There are four different ways to make your website responsive:
- Media Queries
- CSS Grid
- CSS Flexbox
- External Frameworks e.g. Bootstrap

## Media Queries

For example,
```css
@media (max-width: 600px) {
	/* CSS for screens below or equal to 600px wide. */
}
```

CSS Grid is useful for creating 2D layout.

CSS Flexbox is useful for creating a 1D layout.

Bootstrap Framework is built on top of CSS Flexbox.
