CSS Float allows us to wrap text around a particular element.

For example,
```html
<img .../>
<p>text... </p>
```

```css
img {
	float:left;
}
```

Here,
- The content of the `p` element will wrap around the `img` element.
- To move the image to the right of the webpage, we can use `float:right`.

If you don’t want an element to float around the text, then you can set `clear:left`. Here the element is freed from floating to the left. Other values for `clear` attribute include `right` and `both`.
