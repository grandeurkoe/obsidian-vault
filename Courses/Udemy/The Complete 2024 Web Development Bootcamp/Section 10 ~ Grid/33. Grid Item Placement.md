The container that contains all the items is called the **Grid container**.

The items that are placed inside the grid are called **Grid items**.

The rows and columns that are created on creating a grid are collectively called as **Tracks** i.e., Row Tracks and Column Tracks.

Small units that are created within the intersection of these tracks are called as **Grid cells**. Grid cells are the smallest unit in a grid.

Multiple grid cells can be used to create grid items.

Lines that separate tracks are called as **Grid lines**. We have both horizontal and vertical grid lines. You can control these grid lines by using the `gap` property.

```html
<div class="container">
	<div class="item cowboy">🤠</div>
	<div class="item astronaut">👩‍🚀</div>
	<div class="item book">📖</div>
</div>
```

```css
.container {
	height: 100vh;
	display: grid;
	gap: 3 rem;
	grid-template-rows: 1fr 1fr 1.5fr;
	grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;
}
```

Now, I want the cowboy div to span 2 columns.

```css
.cowboy {
	background-color: #00B9FF;
	grid-column: span 2;
}
```
