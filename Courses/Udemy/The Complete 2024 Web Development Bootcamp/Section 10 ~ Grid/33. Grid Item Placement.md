The container that contains all the items is called the **Grid container**.

The items that are placed inside the grid are called **Grid items**.

The rows and columns that are created on creating a grid are collectively called as **Tracks** i.e., Row Tracks and Column Tracks.

Small units that are created within the intersection of these tracks are called as **Grid cells**. Grid cells are the smallest unit in a grid.

Multiple grid cells can be used to create grid items.

Lines that separate tracks are called as **Grid lines**. We have both horizontal and vertical grid lines. You can control these grid lines by using the `gap` property.
