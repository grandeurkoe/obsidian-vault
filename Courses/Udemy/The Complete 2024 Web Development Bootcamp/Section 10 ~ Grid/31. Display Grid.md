You can create a 1D grid, but it behaves a bit differently.

Grids natural inclination is to create a grid and everything lines up with each other on a column and row basis i.e., the gaps between items, within a grid layout, are same.

## How to create a grid?

```html
<div class="container">
	<p>...</p>
	<p>...</p>
	<p>...</p>
	<p>...</p>
</div>
```

Here,
- The four `p` elements are the grid items.
- `div` element is the container which acts like a grid.


```css
.container {
	display: grid;
	grid-template-columns: 1fr 2fr;
	grid-template-rows: 1fr 1fr;
	gap: 10px;
}
```

Here,
- You can set the `display` property of container class to `grid` to make it a CSS grid.
