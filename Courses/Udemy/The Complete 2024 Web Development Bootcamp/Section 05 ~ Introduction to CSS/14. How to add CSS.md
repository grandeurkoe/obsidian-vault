There are three ways of adding CSS into an HTML website:
1. **[[#Inline CSS]]**
2. **[[#Internal CSS]]**
3. **[[#External CSS]]**

## Inline CSS

**Inline CSS** goes into the same line as a particular HTML element.

Inline CSS looks like this:

```html
<html style="background: blue">
</html>
```

Here,
- Inline CSS goes into the opening tag of the HTML.
- `style` attribute is a global attribute.
- Value for the `style` attribute is the CSS code.
- `background` is the property you want to change. `blue` is the value of the `background` property that you want to set it to.

Inline CSS is really useful for adding CSS to  just a single element on your HTML page.
