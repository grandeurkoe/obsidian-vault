There are three ways of adding CSS into an HTML website:
1. **[[#Inline CSS]]**
2. **[[#Internal CSS]]**
3. **[[#External CSS]]**

## Inline CSS

**Inline CSS** goes into the same line as a particular HTML element.

Inline CSS looks like this:

```html
<html style="background: blue">
</html>
```

Here,
- Inline CSS goes into the opening tag of the HTML.
- `style` attribute is a global attribute.
- Value for the `style` attribute is the CSS code.
- `background` is the property you want to change. `blue` is the value of the `background` property that you want to set it to.

Inline CSS is really useful for adding CSS to  just a single element on your HTML page.

If you want multiple elements to share styling, then adding inline styles to each and every single element would be quite tedious. So itâ€™s not recommended to use inline style in your entire document. 

## Internal CSS

To add internal CSS, we use the `style` element.

Inline CSS looks like this:
```html
<html>
	<head>
		<style>
			html{
				background: red;
			}
		</style>
	</head>
</html>
```

Here.
- `html` on line 36 is a selector.
- Internal CSS can be applied to anywhere in the HTML document.

Internal CSS are really useful for applying styling to only on

## External CSS
