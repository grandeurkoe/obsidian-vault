There are three ways of adding CSS into an HTML website:
1. **[[#Inline CSS]]**
2. **[[#Internal CSS]]**
3. **[[#External CSS]]**

## Inline CSS

**Inline CSS** goes into the same line as a particular HTML element.

Inline CSS looks like this:

```html
<html style="background: blue">
</html>
```

Here,
- Inline CSS goes into the opening tag of the HTML.
- `style` attribute is a global attribute.
- Value for the `style` attribute is the CSS code.
- `background` is the property you want to change. `blue` is the value of the `background` property that you want to set it to.

Inline CSS is really useful for adding CSS to  just a single element on your HTML page.

If you want multiple elements to share styling, then adding inline styles to each and every single element would be quite tedious. So it’s not recommended to use inline style in your entire document. 

## Internal CSS

To add internal CSS, we use the `style` element.

Inline CSS looks like this:
```html
<html></html>

```

## External CSS
