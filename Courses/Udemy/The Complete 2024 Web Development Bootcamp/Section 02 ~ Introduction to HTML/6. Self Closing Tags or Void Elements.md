A **void element** is an element where you are forbidden from putting any content inside the tag.

##  Horizontal Rule Element

Horizontal rule element looks like this:
```html
<hr />
```

Horizontal rule element is used to add some separation between elements.

## Break Element

Break rule element looks like this:
```html
<br />
```

Break element is used to separate things onto separate lines.

## Good Practice

1. Do not use `<br />` elements as a substitute for creating separate paragraphs with the `<p>` element.
