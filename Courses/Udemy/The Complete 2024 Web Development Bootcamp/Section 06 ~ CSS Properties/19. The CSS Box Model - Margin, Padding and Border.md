Each element in an HTML file is a box. 

## `width` and `height`

You can change the dimension of these boxes such as width and height.

For example,
```css
h1 {
	width: 600px;
	height: 600px;
}
```

You can also set `height` and `width` as percentages.

For example,
```css
h1 {
	width: 100%;
}
```

This will take the entire width of the website.

## `border`

You can also set the border for each of the HTML element. If every element in an HTML file is a box, then this would be the border of the box

For example,
```css
h1 {
	border: 10px solid black;
}
```
