**Font properties** are used to change the appearance of the text.

Some font properties we’ve seen:
- `color` property sets the text color.
- `font-weight` property sets how bold the text is.
- `font-size` property sets the size of the text.
- `font-family` property sets the typeface.

## `font-size` 

We can change the size of a font by using the `font-size` property.

For example,
```css
h1 {
	font-size: 20px;
}
```

Translation of `font-size` values:
- `1px` = `1/96th inch` = `0.26 mm`
- `1pt` = `1/72nd inch` = `0.35 mm`
- `1em` = 100% of parent. If parent is `20px` and child is `2em`, then child would be `40px`. This is the relative size.
- `1rem` = 100% of root. This is the absolute size. Root element is `html`.

where,
- `px` is pixel.
- `pt` is point.
- `em` is full width of letter ‘m’.

It is recommended to use `rem`, because that is the more consistent way of changing the sizing.

You can also use named font size like, 

```css
html {
	font-size: xx-large;
}
```
