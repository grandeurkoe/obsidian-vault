**HTML Boilerplate** allows us to understand the structure of our HTML files.

HTML Boilerplate looks like this:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
	<head>
		<meta charset="UTF-8">
		<title>My Website</title>
	</head>

	<body>
		<h1>Hello World!</h1>
	</body>
</html>
```

Let’s go through it line by line:
- `<!DOCTYPE html>`: At the top of every HTML file there should be a *Doctype declaration*. It tells the browser which version of HTML the file was written in. The latest version of HTML is HTML5.
- `<html lang="en"></html`: This is the *root* of your document. Everything is going to go inside the opening and closing tags of the html element. `lang` attribute tells the browser the language of the text content. This attribute is useful for screen readers.
- `<head></head>`: This is where the important information about our website is placed that is not going to be displayed to the user. It includes things that will help render the website in the browser correctly, but it doesn’t include any sort of content like text or images or anything that the user will see. The head section must always have the meta tag.
- `<meta charset="UTF-8:>`: This sets the character set encoding of the web page, and in this case, it sets it as “UTF-8”. This ensures that the characters that you’re using in your website are rendered correctly.
