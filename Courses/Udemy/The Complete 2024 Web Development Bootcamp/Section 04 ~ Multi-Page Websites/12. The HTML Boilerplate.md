**HTML Boilerplate** allows us to understand the structure of our HTML files.

HTML Boilerplate looks like this:

```html
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html lang="en">
	<head>
		<meta charset="UTF-8">
		<title>My Website</title>
	</head>

	<body>
		<h1>Hello World!</h1>
	</body>
</html>
```

Letâ€™s go through it line by line:
- At the top of every HTML file there should be a *Doctype declaration*. It tells the browser which version of HTML the file was written in. The latest version of HTML is HTML5.
