**File Path** is a unique location for a file or folder on your computer.

File path can direct someone to either a file or a folder.

*Root* is the starting point of your computer filing system. Also called your hard drive. For example, the C: drive.

There are two types of file paths:
1. **[[#Absolute File Path]]**
2. **[[#Relative File Path]]

## Absolute File Path

**Absolute file path** is a file path that is relative to the root (that is the C: drive) of the computer.

For example,
```PATH
C:/Project/Images/cat.png
```

An advantage of using an absolute file path is that, regardless of your current location on the computer, you can always determine the exact file path. The computer will know how to navigate from the root directory to the specified destination.
## Relative File Path

For web development, a relative file path is a lot more useful than an absolute file path.

**Relative file path** is a file path that is relative to the location where we are writing our code.

Relative file paths are shorter. Also, it doesn’t matter if you move your folder around, it’s always going to be valid.

### Special Characters

Relative file paths comes with special characters that can make it easier for us to navigate the file structure.

One such character is the **double dots (..)**. When we write two double dots (..) at the begging  of a relative path, it means that we go up a level.
