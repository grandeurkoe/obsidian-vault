**File Path** is a unique location for a file or folder on your computer.

File path can direct someone to either a file or a folder.

*Root* is the starting point of your computer filing system. Also called your hard drive. For example, the C: drive.

There are two types of file paths:
1. **[[#Absolute File Path]]**
2. **[[#Relative File Path]]

## Absolute File Path

**Absolute file path** is a file path that is relative to the root (that is the C: drive) of the computer.

For example,
```FILE PAT
```
## Relative File Path
