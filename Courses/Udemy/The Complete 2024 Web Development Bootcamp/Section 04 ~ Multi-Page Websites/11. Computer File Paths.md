**File Path** is a unique location for a file or folder on your computer.

File path can direct someone to either a file or a folder.

*Root* is the starting point of your computer filing system. Also called your hard drive. For example, the C: drive.

There are two types of file paths:
1. **[[#Absolute File Path]]**
2. **[[#Relative File Path]]

## Absolute File Path

**Absolute file path** is a file path that is relative to the root (that is the C: drive) of the computer.

For example,
```PATH
C:/Project/Images/cat.png
```

An advantage of using an absolute file path is that, regardless of your current location on the computer, you can always determine the exact file path. The computer will know how to navigate from the root directory to the specified destination.
## Relative File Path
