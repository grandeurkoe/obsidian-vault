There are two types of lists:
1. Unordered Lists
2. Ordered Lists

## Unordered List

In an unordered list, the sequence in which the items are listed does not matter.

Unordered list looks like this:

```html
<ul>
	<li>Milk</li>
	<li>Egg</li>
	<li>Flour</li>
</ul>
```

Here,
- `<ul></ul>` is the unordered list tags.
- `<li></li>` is the list item tag. All three list items are enclosed inside the unordered list.

## Ordered List

In an ordered list, the sequence in which the items are listed does matter.

Ordered list looks like this:

```html
<ol>
	<li>Milk</li>
	<li>Egg</li>
	<li>Flour</li>
</ol>
```

Here,
- `<ol></ol>` is the ordered list tags.
- `<li></li>` is the list item tag. All three list items are enclosed inside the ordered list.
