**Anchor element** allows us to create hyperlinks.

Anchor element looks like this:

```html
<a href="http://www.google.com">This is a link.</a>
```

Here,
- `<a>` is the opening tag.
- `</a>` is the closing tag.
- `This is a link.`is the content of the `a` element.
- `href` is an attribute of the anchor element. It goes inside the opening tag. It refers to the URL that the hyperlink points to.

Attribute adds additional information to the HTML element.

**Global attributes** are attributes that can be applied to all the HTML elements.

For example,

```html
<a href="https://www.google.com" draggable=true>This is a link to Google</a>
```

Here,
- `draggable` attribute is a global attribute. If you set this attribute as `true`, then your hyperlink would become draggable.
