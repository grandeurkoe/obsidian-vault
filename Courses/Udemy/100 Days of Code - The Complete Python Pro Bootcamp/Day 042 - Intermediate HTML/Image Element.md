# Image Element

The Image element allows us to add images to our website.

The image elements looks like this -

![[Pasted image 20231010095634.png|150]]

The image element is a void element.

After the url in src attribute, you can specify the size of the image. For example above, the photo would have a size of 200px * 200px.

The alt attribute allows us to add an alternative text description for the image so that blind people can hear what the image is displaying.
