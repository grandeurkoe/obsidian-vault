# What is HTML?

[HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) stands for HyperText Markup Language.

HyperText are pieces of text that link to other documents in the website.

Markup Language are essentially tags that represent the type of data between them like
```html
<h1>Hi!</h1>.
<!-- Here the h1 tag tells us that Hi! is a heading. -->
```
