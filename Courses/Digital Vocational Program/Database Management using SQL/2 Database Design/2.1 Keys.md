These are the various types of keys used in an RDBMS. These keys are:

- **Primary key** - Every table must have some column or combination of columns that uniquely identifies each row in the table. This column (or columns) is called the *primary key* of the table.
- **Foreign Key** - A column in one table whose value matches the primary key in some other table is called a *foreign key*.
