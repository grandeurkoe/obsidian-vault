The relational model is based on the principle of relational algebra. Relational algebra is a collection of operators that operate on relations. Each operator take one or two relations as its input and produce a new relation as its output.

The following operators have been defined as relational operators:
- RESTRICT
- PROJECT
- PRODUCT
- UNION
- INTERSECT
- DIFFERENCE
- JOIN
- DIVIDE

## RESTRICT

The RESTRICT operator extract specified tuples or row from a given relation based on a condition.

The condition is to extract the tuples from the above STUDENT table of only those students who age is more than 25. The following table describes the resultant relation.

## PROJECT

The project operator extracts specified attributes or columns from a given relation.

You can use the PROJECT operator, if you want to extract only the name and age of all the students.

## PRODUCT

The PRODUCT operator joins two relations such that every tuple of the first relation is matched with every tuple of the second relation. To be product compatible, the two table must have common attributes.

The PRODUCT operator creates the Cartesian product between the two tables. For example, T_CODE column is a common attribute in the following TEACHER and BATCH tables.

## UNION

The union operator builds the relation from tuples appearing in either or both of the specified relations.

To be union compatible, the two table should have the same type of attributes (sets of columns having the same types). 

Consider the following tables, A and B.

The following table illustrates the union operation on tables, A and B.

## INTERSECT

The INTERSECT operator builds a relation consisting of tuples that appear in both the relations.

Consider the following tables, A and B.

The following table illustrates the intersect operation on tables, A and B.

## DIFFERENCE

The DIFFERENCE operator build a relation of tuples appearing in the first but not in the second of the two specified relations.

The following table illustrates the difference operation on tables, A and B.
