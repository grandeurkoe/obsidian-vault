The relational model is based on the principle of relational algebra. Relational algebra is a collection of operators that operate on relations. Each operator take one or two relations as its input and produce a new relation as its output.

The following operators have been defined as relational operators:
- RESTRICT
- PROJECT
- PRODUCT
- UNION
- INTERSECT
- DIFFERENCE
- JOIN
- DIVIDE

## RESTRICT

The RESTRICT operator extract specified tuples or row from a given relation based on a condition.
