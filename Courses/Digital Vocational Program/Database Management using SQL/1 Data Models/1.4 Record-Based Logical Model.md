The three types of record-based logical models are:
- **Hierarchical model**: In this model, data is represented in the form of a tree, and relationship between the data are represented by links.
- **Network model**: In this model, the data and relationship among them are represented in the form of records and links. It is similar to hierarchical model. However, records in a database are represented graphically.
- **Relational model**: In this model, the table in a database has a fixed length record with fixed number of attributes or fields. Of these three models, the relational model is the most popular.
