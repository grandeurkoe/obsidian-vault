The three types of record-based logical models are:
- **Hierarchical model**: In this model, data is represented in the form of a tree, and relationship between the data are represented by links.
- **Network model**: In this model, the data and relationship among them are represented in the form of records and links. It is similar to hierarchical model. However, records in a database are represented graphically.
- **Relational model**: In this model, the table in a database has a fixed length record with fixed number of attributes or fields. Of these three models, the relational model is the most popular.

## Relational Model

Dr. E.F. Codd first described the relational model in 1970.

The relational model is an attempt to simplify the database structure. It represents all data in the database as simple tables in the row-column format.
