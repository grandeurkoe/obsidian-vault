There are various object-based logical models, such as Entity Relationship (ER) model, object-oriented model, and binary model.

The most widely used is the ER model. 

Peter Chen introduced this model in 1976.

## The ER Model

The ER model view the real world as a collection of objects or entities and the relationship among them.

**Relationship**: TAUGHT

### Entities

An entity is any object, place, person, or activity about which data is recorded.

An entity can be categorized as *entity type* and *entity instance*.

An entity type is a set of things that share common properties. For example, STUDENT, COURSE, and GRADE.

An entity instance is an individual occurrence of an entity type. For example,  John is an instance of STUDENT entity type.

There are two types of entities, *dependent* and *independent*.

An entity, which depends on another entity for existence, is called a *dependent entity*.

An *independent entity* does not depend on any other entity for existence.

Dependent entities are also called *weak entities*, and independent entities are called *regular entities*.

For example, the university offers a course in database design in the second semester. Therefore, the “database design” is an instance of the COURSE entity. The university can offer this course only if the entity instance “database design” already exists. If the university decides to drop the entity instance “database design” from the curriculum, the offering of the course must also be dropped.

A dependent entity is represented by a double-lined box and is connected by a line to the entity it depends on.
