An entity is any object, place, person, or activity about which data is recorded.

An entity can be categorized as entity type and entity instance.

An entity type is a set of things that share common properties. For example, STUDENT, COURSE, and GRADE.

An entity instance is an individual occurrence of an entity type. For example,  John is an instance of STUDENT entity type.
