The three types of record-based logical models are:
- **Hierarchical model**: In this model, data is represented in the form of a tree, and relationship between the data are represented by links.
- **Network model**: In this model, the data and relationship among them are represented in the form of records and links. It is similar to hierarchical model. However, records in a database are represented graphically.
- **Relational model**: In this model, the table in a database has a fixed length record with fixed number of attributes or fields. Of these three models, the relational model is the most popular.

## Relational Model

Dr. E.F. Codd first described the relational model in 1970.

The relational model is an attempt to simplify the database structure. It represents all data in the database as simple tables in the row-column format.

An *Relational Database Management System (RDMS)* can be defined as a database management system where all the data visible to the user is organized strictly as table of data values, and all the database operations work on these tables.

### Relational Data Structure

The basic principle in a relational database is a tabular arrangement of data values. Each table in a database has a unique table name that identifies its contents.

The row (or records) in the table is called a *tuple*, and the column (or field) is called an *attribute*. Every column in a table must have a unique name. The number of tuples is called the *cardinality* of the table, and the number of attributes is called the *degree* of the table.

Every table must have some column or combination of columns that uniquely identifies each row in the table. This column (or columns) is called the *primary key* of the table.

A table where every row is different from all the other rows is called a *relation*. The term relational database comes from this term.

Each attribute of a table has an associated domain. A *domain* is a collection of values from which one or more attributes (or columns) draw their actual values. For example, the domain for the CODE attribute would be the set of all legal supplier codes. A set of values appearing in that column, at any given time, would be a subset of that domain.

### Representing Missing Information

In RDBMS, missing or unknown information is represented as a NULL value in a table.

### Representing Relationship in an RDBMS

Relationships in an RDBMS are represent by common data values stored in two or more tables.

A column in one table whose value matches the primary key in some other table is called a *foreign key*.

Together, a primary key and a foreign key create a parent-child relationship between the tables that connect them.
