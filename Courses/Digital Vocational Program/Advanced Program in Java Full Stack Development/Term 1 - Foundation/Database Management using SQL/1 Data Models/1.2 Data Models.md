A *data model* is a description of data in a database. In addition, the data model describes the relationship among data, and any constraint that have to be defined on the data.

Data models can be broadly classified into the following categories:
- **[Object-based logical model](1.3%20Object-Based%20Logical%20Model.md)**: Focuses on describing the data, relationship among the data, and any constraints defined.
- **[Record-based logical model](1.4%20Record-Based%20Logical%20Model.md)**: Focuses on specifying the logical structuring of the database in the form of tables.
