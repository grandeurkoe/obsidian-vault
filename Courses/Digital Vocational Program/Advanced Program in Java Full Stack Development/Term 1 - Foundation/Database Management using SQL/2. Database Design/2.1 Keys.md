These are the various types of keys used in an RDBMS. These keys are:

- **Primary key** - Every table must have some column or combination of columns that uniquely identifies each row in the table. This column (or columns) is called the *primary key* of the table.
- **Foreign Key** - A column in one table whose value matches the primary key in some other table is called a *foreign key*.
- **Candidate Key** - Any attribute that uniquely identifies a row in a table is a candidate for the primary key. Such attribute is called a candidate key.
- **Alternate Key** - Any attribute that is a candidate for the primary key but is not the primary key is called the alternate key.
- **Composite Key** - When the key that uniquely identifies the rows of the table is made up of more than one attribute, it is called a composite key.
