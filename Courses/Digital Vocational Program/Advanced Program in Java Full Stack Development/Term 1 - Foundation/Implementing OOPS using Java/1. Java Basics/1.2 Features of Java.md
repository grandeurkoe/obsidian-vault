8. *[[#Interpreted]]*
9. *[[#High Performance]]*
10. *[[#Multithreaded]]*
11. *[[#Distributed]]*
12. *[[#Dynamic]]*

## Simple

According to Sun Microsystem, Java language is a simple programming language because:
- Java syntax is based on C++.
- Java has removed many complicated and rarely-used features, for example, explicit pointers, operator overloading, etc.
- There is no need to remove unreferenced objects because their is Automatic Garbage Collection in Java.

## Object-Oriented

Java is an object-oriented programming language. Everything in Java is an object. Object-oriented means we organize our software as a combination of different types of objects that incorporate both data and behavior.

Object-oriented programming (OOPs) is a methodology that simplifies software development and maintenance by providing some rules.

Basic OOPs concepts are:
1. Object
2. Class
3. Inheritance
4. Polymorphism
5. Abstraction
6. Encapsulation

## Portable

Java is portable because it facilitates you to carry the Java bytecode to any platform. It doesnâ€™t require any implementation.

## Platform Independent

Java is platform independent because it is different from other languages like C, C++ etc. which are compiled into platform specific machines while Java is *Write Once, Run Anywhere* language.

There are two types of platforms, software-based and hardware-based. Java provides a software-based platform.

The Java platform differs from most other platforms
