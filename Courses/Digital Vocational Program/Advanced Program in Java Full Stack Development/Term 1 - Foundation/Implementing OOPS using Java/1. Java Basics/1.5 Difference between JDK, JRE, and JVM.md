## Java Virtual Machine (JVM)

**Java Virtual Machine (JVM)** is an abstract machine. It is called a virtual machine because it physically doesn't exist. It is a specification that provides a runtime environment in which Java bytecode can be executed. It can also run those programs which are written in other languages and compiled to Java bytecode.

JVMs are available for many hardware and software platforms. JVM, JRE, and JDK are platform dependent because the configuration of each OS is different from each other. However, Java is platform independent. There are three notions of JVM:
1. *Specification*
2. *Implementation*
3. *Instance*

The JVM performs the following main tasks:
- Loads code
- Verifies code
- Executes code
- Provides runtime environment

## Java Runtime Environment (JRE)

The JRE is a set of software tools which are used for develop Java applications. It is used to provide the runtime environment. It is the implementation of JVM. It physically exists. It contains a set of libraries and other files that the JVM uses as runtime.

## Java Development Kit (JDK)

JDK is a software development environment which is used to develop Java applications and applets. It physically exists. It contains the JRE+ development tools.

JDK contains a private JVM and a few other resources such as interpreter/loader (java), compiler (`javac`), an archiver (jar), a documentation generator (`javadoc`), etc. to complete the development of a Java application.
