## What happens at compile time?

At compile time, the Java file is compiled by the Java compiler and converts the Java code into bytecode.

```mermaid

	A[HelloWorld.java] --> B[javac compiler]
	B --> C[HelloWorld.class] 
```

Java Source Code → `HelloWorld.java` 
Java bytecode → `HelloWorld.class `

## What happens at runtime?

At runtime, the following steps are performed:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
	A[Class file] --> B[Classloader]
	B --> C[Bytecode verifier]
	C --> D[Interpreter]
	D --> E[Runtime]
	E --> F[Hardware]
```
- **`Classloader`**: It is a subsystem of JVM that is used to load class files
- **Bytecode verifier**: Checks the code fragment for illegal code that can violate access rights to objects.
- **Interpreter**: Read bytecode stream then execute the instructions.
