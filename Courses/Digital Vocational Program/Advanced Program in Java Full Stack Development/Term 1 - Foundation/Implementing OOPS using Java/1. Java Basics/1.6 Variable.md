A *variable* is a named storage location where a value can be stored.

There are three types of variables in Java:
1. [[#Local variable]]
2. [[#Instance variable]]
3. [[#Static variable]]
## Local variable

A variable declared inside the body of the method is called a *local variable*. You can use this variable only within that method and other methods in the class aren’t even aware that the variable exists.

A local variable cannot be defined with “static” keyword.

## Instance variable

A variable declared inside the class but outside the body of the method, is called an *instance variable*. It cannot be declared as static.

It is called an instance variable because its value instance-specific and is not shared among instances.

## Static variable

A variable that is declared as static is called a static variable. It cannot be local. You can create a single copy of the static variable and share it among all the instances of the class. Memory allocation for static variable happens only one when the class is loaded in the memory.

## Example

```java
public class Variables {
	static int staticVariable = 100; 
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		
	}
}
```
