A *variable* is a named storage location where a value can be stored.

There are three types of variables in Java:
1. [[#Local variable]]
2. [[#Instance variable]]
3. [[#Static variable]]
## Local variable

A variable declared inside the body of the method is called a local variable. You can use this variable only within that method and other methods in the class aren’t even aware that the variable exists.

A local variable cannot be defined with “static” keyq

## Instance variable

## Static variable
