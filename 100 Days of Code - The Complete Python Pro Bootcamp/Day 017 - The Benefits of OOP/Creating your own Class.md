# Creating your own Class

You can create your own Class like this -
```python
class ClassName :
	pass
```

You can use the 'pass' keyword in a class or a function if you don't want to write any code at that point in time.

The following are the case types used in python.

1. PascalCase - First letter of every word is a capital letter.
2. camelCase - First letter of the first word is not a capital letter. First letter of every subsequent word is a capital letter.
3. snake_case - Every letter is lower case. Each word is separated by an underscore.

camelCase is not widely used in Python.
