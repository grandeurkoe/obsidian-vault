# HTTP Requests

There are four different types of HTTP Requests -

1. `GET` - We've already used the requests.get() function to retrieve data from an external system by passing API Endpoints and Parameters.
2. `POST`Â  - requests.post() function allows us to give data to an external system.
3. `PUT` - requests.put() function allows us to update data in an external system.
4. `DELETE` - requests.delete() function allows us to delete data from an external system.
