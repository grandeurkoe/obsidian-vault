# API Authentication

Most API services provide a free tier for education purposes.

But how do you make sure that the API free tier is not being exploited. Thatâ€™s where API Key comes into picture.

API Keys are like your own personal account number and password. API Keys authorize access to a given API.

API Providers can track these API keys to find out how much you are using their API. They can revoke access to the API once you've gone over the limit.

Different API providers have different ways to authenticate their users, but most of them require API keys.
