# HTML Boilerplate

HTML Boilerplate allows us to understand the structure of our website.

`<!DOCTYPE html>` tells the browser what version of HTML theÂ file was written in. The current version of HTML being used is HTML5.

`<html lang="en"></html>` is the root of the HTML file. Every element is encompassed within the html element. The`lang`attribute tells the browser what language the content is written in. 

A *container tag* is the one that needs to be closed if opened. It is, therefore, also called a paired tag and encloses the entire content inside it. Whereas, an *empty tag* need not be closed. It has no content inside it but possesses only the attributes.

`<head></head>`element is where the important information about our website will be placed. This information is not available to the users of the website.

Always have a `<meta charset="UTF-8"></meta>` element in the `<head>` element. This ensures that the characters are displayed properly on your website.

Always have a `<title></title>` element in your website. The content inside the title tag will be displayed in the tab of the browser.

After the head element we have the `<body></body>` element. All the content of the website is available in this element.
