## Hierarchy

Rules of hierarchy involve conveying the most important information first.

Hierarchies can be established in a number of ways.

The most obvious is the use of color.

Size can also be used to establish hierarchy. For example, bigger buttons attract way more attention that smaller ones.

In addition to hierarchy, using good layout can make your website much more interesting.

## Layout

In terms of UI design, there is an optimal line length. You should aim for 40 - 60 characters per line.

## White Space

White space refers to the empty space around text or elements. Adding white space in your design can make it more minimalist and elevated.

## Audience

Target audience is a big factor when it comes to UI design.

If your target audience is kids, then the above second design will be way better than the first one.
