# HTML Heading Element

The Heading element starts with an opening tag and ends with a closing tag.
```html
<h1>Heading 1</h1>
<!-- Here <h1> is the opening tag and </h1> is the closing tag and "Heading
 1" is the content. -->
```

The whole `<h1>Heading 1</h1>` is an element.

There are six heading elements from `<h1></h1`> to `<h6></h6>`.

It is not good practice to have more than one `<h1>`.

Don't skip a heading level i.e. don't go from `<h1>` directly to `<h3>`.
