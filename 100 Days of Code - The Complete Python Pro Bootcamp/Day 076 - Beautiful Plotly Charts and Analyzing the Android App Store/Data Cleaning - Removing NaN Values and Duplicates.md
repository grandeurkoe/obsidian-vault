# Data Cleaning: Removing NaN Values and Duplicates

## Preliminary Data Exploration

Compared to the previous projects we are working with a fairly large DataFrame this time.

```python
1. df_apps.shape
```

tells us we have 10841 rows and 12 columns.

We can already see that there are some data issues that we need to fix. In the Ratings and Type columns there are NaN (Not a number values) and in the Price column we have dollar signs that will cause problems.

The `.sample(n)` method will give us n random rows. This is another handy way to inspect our DataFrame.

## Dropping Unused Columns and Removing NaN Values

To remove the unwanted columns, we simply provide a list of the column names `['Last_Updated', â€˜Android_Ver']` to the `.drop()` method. By setting `axis=1` we are specifying that we want to drop certain columns.
