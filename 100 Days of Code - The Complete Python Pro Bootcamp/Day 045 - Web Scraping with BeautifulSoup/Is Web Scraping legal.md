# Is Web Scraping legal?

If it isn't behind an authentication or captcha then scraping is permissible.

Anything available publicly is open to [web scraping](Web%20Scraping%20with%20BeautifulSoup.md).

To see if what kind of scraping is disallowed by websites, type robots.txt at the end of the url. Like this -

Being legal doesn't mean it is ethical. Would you like if other people scraped your website.

It is good practice to scrape data after a minute delay to make sure that you don't overload the server.
