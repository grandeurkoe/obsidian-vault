# Data Exploration - Making Sense of Google Search Data

Your first step is to explore the data, by getting an understanding of what's actually in those .csv files for this project.

Start with `df_tesla`, then have a look at `df_unemployment` and finally, check out the two bitcoin DataFrames.

#### Challenge

Try to answer these questions about the DataFrames:

- What are the shapes of the DataFrames?
    
- How many rows & columns do they have?
    
- What are the column names?
    
- What is the largest number in the search data column? Try using the `.describe()` function.
    
- What is the periodicity of the time series data (daily, weekly, monthly)?
