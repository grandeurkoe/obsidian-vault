# Investigate the Films that had Zero Revenue

Now that we've done some legwork on cleaning our data, we can investigate our data set more thoroughly.

#### Challenge 1

1. What is the average production budget of the films in the data set?
2. What is the average worldwide gross revenue of films?
3. What were the minimums for worldwide and domestic revenue?
4. Are the bottom 25% of films actually profitable or do they lose money?
5. What are the highest production budget and highest worldwide gross revenue of any film?
6. How much revenue did the lowest and highest budget films make?
