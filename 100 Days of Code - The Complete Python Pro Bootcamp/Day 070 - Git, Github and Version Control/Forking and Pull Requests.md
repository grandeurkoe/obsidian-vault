# Forking and Pull Requests

Forking involves getting a Remote Repository from another Github user and having a version of it on our own Github account as a Remote Repository.

Any changes that I've made on my own forked version will only be present in my own version of the repository. Now, if I wish to incorporate these changes into the original repository then I would have to make a PULL request.
