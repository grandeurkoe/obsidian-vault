# Time Module

The time module provides various time-related functions.

The time module comes in-built in Python.

The time module allows you to add a wait time in your program. This can be done using the `sleep()` function.

The `sleep()` function can be implemented like this -
```python
# This will cause a 1 second delay.
time.sleep(1)
```
