# Broadcasting, Scalars and Matrix Multiplication

## Linear Algebra with Vectors

NumPy is designed to do math (and do it well!). This means that NumPy will treat vectors, matrices and tensors in a way that a mathematician would expect. For example, if you had two vectors:

```python
1. v1 = np.array([4, 5, 2, 7])
2. v2 = np.array([2, 1, 3, 3])
```
And you add them together

`1. v1 + v2`

The result will be a ndarray where all the elements have been added together.

`array([ 6, 6, 5, 10])`

In contrast, if we had two Python Lists

```python
1. list1 = [4, 5, 2, 7]
2. list2 = [2, 1, 3, 3]
```

adding them together would just concatenate the lists.

```python
1. list1 + list2
2. # output:Â [4, 5, 2, 7, 2, 1, 3, 3]
```

Multiplying the two vectors together also results in an element by element operation:

`1. v1 * v2`

Gives us `array([ 8, 5, 6, 21])` since 4x2=8, 5x1=5 and so on. And for a Python List, this operation would not work at all.

`1. list1 * list2 # error!`

## Broadcasting

Now, oftentimes you'll want to do some sort of operation between an array and a single number. In mathematics, this single number is often called a **scalar**. For example, you might want to multiply every value in your NumPy array by 2:

![[2020-10-12_16-01-36-b9c2fefd91ad6764599526cd883cc721.gif|500]]

In order to achieve this result, NumPy will make the shape of the smaller array - our scalar - compatible with the larger array. This is what the documentation refers to when it mentions the term "broadcasting".

The same rules about 'expanding' the smaller ndarray hold true for 2 or more dimensions. We can see this with a 2-Dimensional Array:

```python
1. array_2d = np.array([[1, 2, 3, 4], 
2.                      [5, 6, 7, 8]])
```

The scalar operates on an element by element basis.

The documentation on broadcasting also shows us a few more examples:
