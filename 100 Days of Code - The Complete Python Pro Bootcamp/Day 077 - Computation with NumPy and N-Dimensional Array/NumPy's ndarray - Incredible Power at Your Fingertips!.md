# NumPy's ndarray - Incredible Power at Your Fingertips!

Let‚Äôs import NumPy

We‚Äôll follow convention and use the name `np`.

The crown jewel of NumPy is the `ndarray`. The **ndarray** is a _homogeneous n-dimensional array_ object. What does that mean? ü§®

A Python List or a Pandas DataFrame can contain a mix of strings, numbers, or objects (i.e., a mix of different types). **Homogenous** means all the data have to have the same data type, for example all floating-point numbers.

And **n-dimensional** means that we can work with everything from a single column (1-dimensional) to the matrix (2-dimensional) to a bunch of matrices stacked on top of each other (n-dimensional).

## 1-Dimension

Let‚Äôs create a 1-dimensional array (i.e., a ‚Äúvector‚Äù)

`1. my_array = np.array([1.1, 9.2, 8.1, 4.7])`

We can see `my_array` is 1 dimensional by looking at its shape

`1. my_array.shape`

We access an element in a ndarray similar to how we work with a Python List, namely by that element's index:

`1. my_array[2]`

Let‚Äôs check the dimensions of `my_array` with the `ndim` attribute:

`1. my_array.ndim`

## 2-Dimensions

Now, let‚Äôs create a 2-dimensional array (i.e., a ‚Äúmatrix‚Äù)

``1. array_2d = np.array([[1, 2, 3, 9], [5, 6, 7, 8]])``

Note we have two pairs of square brackets. This array has 2 rows and 4 columns. NumPy refers to the dimensions as **axes**, so the first axis has length 2 and the second axis has length 4.

```python
1. print(f'array_2d has {array_2d.ndim} dimensions')
2. print(f'Its shape is {array_2d.shape}')
3. print(f'It has {array_2d.shape[0]} rows and {array_2d.shape[1]} columns')
4. print(array_2d)
```

Again, you can access a particular row or a particular value with the square bracket notation. To access a particular value, you have to provide an index for each dimension. We have two dimensions, so we need to provide an index for the row and for the column. Here‚Äôs how to access the 3rd value in the 2nd row:

`1. array_2d[1,2]`

To access an entire row and all the values therein, you can use the `:`¬†operator just like you would do with a Python List. Here‚Äôs the entire first row:

`1. array_2d[0, :]`
