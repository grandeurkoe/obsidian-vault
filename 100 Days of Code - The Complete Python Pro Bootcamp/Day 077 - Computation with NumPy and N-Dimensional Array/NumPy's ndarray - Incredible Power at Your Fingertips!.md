Weâ€™ll follow convention and use the name `np`.

The crown jewel of NumPy is the `ndarray`. The **ndarray** is a _homogeneous n-dimensional array_ object. What does that mean? ðŸ¤¨

A Python List or a Pandas DataFrame can contain a mix of strings, numbers, or objects (i.e., a mix of different types). **Homogenous** means all the data have to have the same data type, for example all floating-point numbers.

And **n-dimensional** means that we can work with everything from a single column (1-dimensional) to the matrix (2-dimensional) to a bunch of matrices stacked on top of each other (n-dimensional).
