# Templating with Jinja

Jinja is a templating language build for python.

Jinja allows us to load the contents of our website dynamically.

Jinja allows us to add python code into out html template files.

Anything between two curly braces is evaluated as python code.

These `{{ }}` are called as Jinja markers.

For multiline Python code, we encompass the code within `{% %}`.

Use the `url_for()` function for building url in an HTML file.
