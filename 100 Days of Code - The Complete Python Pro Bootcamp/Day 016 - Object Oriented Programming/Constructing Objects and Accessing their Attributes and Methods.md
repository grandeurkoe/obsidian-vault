# Constructing Objects and Accessing their Attributes and Methods

## Classes and Objects

Classes are like blueprints.

Objects are the actual objects or items created using the blueprint.

## Constructing Objects

You can create objects like this -
```python
object_name = ClassName()Â 
```

Class name should follow Pascal's case i.e., First letter of each word should be uppercase.

## Accessing their Attributes and Methods

You can use attributes and methods of a class like this -
```python
object_name.attribute_name = value
object_name.method_name()
```
