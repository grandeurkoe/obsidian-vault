# Visualizing Distributions and Testing for Statistical Significance

There are even more powerful arguments we can make to convince our fellow doctors in clinic 1 of the virtues of handwashing. The first are statistics regarding the mean monthly death rate. The second are compelling visualizations to accompany the statistics.

## Challenge 1:Â Calculate the Difference in the Average Monthly Death Rate

- What was the average percentage of monthly deaths before handwashing (i.e., before June 1847)?
- What was the average percentage of monthly deaths after handwashing was made obligatory?
- By how much did handwashing reduce the average chance of dying in childbirth in percentage terms?
- How do these numbers compare to the average for all the 1840s that we calculated earlier?
- How many times lower are the chances of dying after handwashing compared to before?
