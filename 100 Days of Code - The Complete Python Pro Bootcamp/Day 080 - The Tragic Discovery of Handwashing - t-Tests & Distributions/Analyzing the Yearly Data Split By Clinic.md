## Challenge 1:Â The Yearly Data Split by Clinic

Let's turn our attention to the annual data. Use plotly to create line charts of the births and deaths of the two different clinics at the Vienna General Hospital.

- Which clinic is bigger or more busy judging by the number of births?
- Has the hospital had more patients over time?
- What was the highest number of deaths recorded in clinic 1 and clinic 2?
