## Challenge 1:Â The Yearly Data Split by Clinic

Let's turn our attention to the annual data. Use Plotly to create line charts of the births and deaths of the two different clinics at the Vienna General Hospital.

- Which clinic is bigger or more busy judging by the number of births?
- Has the hospital had more patients over time?
- What was the highest number of deaths recorded in clinic 1 and clinic 2?

## Solution to Challenge 1

To show two line charts side by side we can use Plotly and provide the clinic column as the `color`.

```python
1. line = px.line(df_yearly, 
2.                x='year', 
3.                y='births',
4.                color='clinic',
5.                title='Total Yearly Births by Clinic')
6.
7. line.show()
```

We see that more and more women gave birth at the hospital over the years. Clinic 1, which was staffed by male doctors and medical students was also the busier or simply the larger ward. More births took place in clinic 1 than in clinic 2.
