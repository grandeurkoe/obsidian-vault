Java is a class-based, object-oriented programming language.

Java is intended to let application developers **write once, and run anywhere (WORA)**, meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation.

Java is widely used for developing applications for desktop, web, and mobile devices.

Java is known for its *simplicity, robustness, and security features, making it a popular choice for enterprise-level applications.
