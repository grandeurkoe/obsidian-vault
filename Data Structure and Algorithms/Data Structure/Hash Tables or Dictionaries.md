# Hash Tables or Dictionaries

Hash Tables or Hash Maps are referred to as dictionaries in python.

Hash function is simply a function that generates a value of fixed length for each input it gets.

(Key, Value) -> Hash function -> Generates a value of fixed length -> Memory address selected in storage based on value generated by hash -> Value from (Key, Value) stored at the location selected in storage.

Hash collision is one of the bigger drawback of using Hash Tables.

Hash collision happens when the hash function assign the same address to two different keys.

Assigning values to same address severely slow down all operations(read/write) by a time complexity of O(n/k) where k is the size of the hash table. Simplifying this to O(n) based of Big O rules.

There are a lot of methods to resolve hash collision like Cuckoo hashing, Hopscotch hashing, Coalesced hashing, etc.,

## Time Complexity

1. LOOKUP - O(1)
2. PUSH - O(1)
3. INSERT - O(1)
4. DELETE - O(1)

## What are Hash Table good for?

1. Fast lookup.
2. Fast insert.
3. Flexible Keys.

## What are Hash Table bad for?

1. Unordered. (Not a problem in Python because dictionaries are ordered.)
2. Slow key iteration.
