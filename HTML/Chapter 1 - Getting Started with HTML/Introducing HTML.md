A **Website** is a collection of one or more related webpages.

These webpages can either be **Static** or **Dynamic**.

Static webpages are delivered to the user as they are stored. The content of these webpages does not update dynamically.

In contrast, in dynamic webpages, the content is rendered at the time of the request.

For example, while surfing any website on the Internet, you must have seen the *Contact Us* page that shows how to reach or contact the various offices of an organization. The content of this page is delivered to the users without any change. This is known as a *Static Webpage*. Now, consider an example of a *Dynamic Webpage*. If you want to access your Gmail account, you need to enter your credentials. Depending on whether the credentials are correct or not, the corresponding page is displayed. For example, if your credentials are valid, your inbox page is displayed. If your credentials are not valid, a page displaying a message that the credentials provided are incorrect appears to you. This is a dynamic behavior of a webpage.

One of the most popular language for designing a webpage is [HTML](What%20is%20HTML.md).
