A **Website** is a collection of one or more related webpages.

These webpages can either be **static** or **dynamic**.

Static webpages are delivered to the user as they are stored. The content of these webpages does not update dynamically.

One of the most popular language for designing a webpage is [HTML](What%20is%20HTML.md).
