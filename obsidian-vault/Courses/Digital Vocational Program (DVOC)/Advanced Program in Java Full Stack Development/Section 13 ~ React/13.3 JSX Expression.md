## What is JSX?

**JSX** (JavaScript XML) is a **syntax extension** for JavaScript, used to describe the **UI structure** in a React component. It allows you to write **HTML-like** code inside JavaScript, which makes it easier to create and visualize the UI.

### Key Points:

- JSX extends **JavaScript** by adding XML-like syntax.
- It simplifies creating **HTML elements** using JavaScript.
- When building a React app, JSX is **preprocessed** into pure JavaScript code by a specific parser.

A JSX expression generates a **React element**, which is similar to an **HTML element** but in the React environment.

### Example of Valid JSX:

```jsx
<div><h1>Hello World!</h1></div>
```

- The above JSX expression is valid because it returns a single parent element (`<div>`).

---

### Example of Invalid JSX:

```jsx
<div><h1>Hello World!</h1></div>
<div><h2>Good Morning!</h2></div>
```

- In JSX, multiple elements **must** be wrapped in a single parent element. The above code will throw an error because there are two sibling `div` elements.

To fix it, you would need to wrap them in a single parent, like this:

```jsx
<div>
  <h1>Hello World!</h1>
  <h2>Good Morning!</h2>
</div>
```

---

### Assigning JSX to a Variable:

You can assign a JSX expression to a variable, just like any other JavaScript expression:

```js
let output = <div><h1>Hello World!</h1></div>;
```

This `output` variable now holds the JSX markup, which can be rendered within a component.

## Comments in JSX

You can add comments inside JSX, but they must be written in a specific way:

- **Single-line comment:** Use `//` for regular JavaScript comments, but not inside JSX.
- **Multi-line comments:** Use `/* */` for comments inside JSX.

Example:

```jsx
<div>
  <h1>{/* This is a comment inside JSX */}</h1>
</div>
```

- The comment inside `{/* */}` will not be rendered in the output.
