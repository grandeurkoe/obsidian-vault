## What is a Component?

In React, **components** are the fundamental building blocks of the user interface.

- A **component** is a self-contained unit of code responsible for rendering a part of the UI.
- Components can be thought of as small, reusable pieces of the interface, and they can contain other components within them.
- Components help in breaking down the UI into manageable sections, each of which can handle its own state and logic.

### Key Points:

- **Any visual item** in the user interface can be considered a component.
- Components are often organized in a **hierarchical structure**, known as the **component tree**.
- For example:
    - A **form** on a webpage can be a component.
    - A **textbox** within that form can also be a component.
- Components can be either **class-based** or **functional** (more on this below).

### Types of Components:

1. **Class Components**  
    Class components are ES6 classes that extend from `React.Component`. They have the ability to hold **state** and **lifecycle methods**.
2. **Functional Components**  
    Functional components are simpler and typically donâ€™t have state or lifecycle methods. They are written as functions that return JSX.

### Class Component Template

A basic example of a **Class Component** in React:

```jsx
import React from "react";

class Welcome extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>Welcome to Class Component</h1>;
  }
}

export default Welcome;
```

#### Explanation:

- The class `Welcome` extends `React.Component`.
- Inside the class, the `render()` method returns JSX, which will be rendered to the screen.
- `export default Welcome;` makes the component available for use in other files.
