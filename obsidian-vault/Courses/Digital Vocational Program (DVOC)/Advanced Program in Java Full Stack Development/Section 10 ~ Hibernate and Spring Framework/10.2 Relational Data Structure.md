The basic principle in a relational database is a tabular arrangement of data values. Each table in a database has a unique table name that identifies its contents.

The row (or record) in the table is called a *tuple*, and the column (or field) is called an *attribute*. Every column in a table must have a unique name.

The number of tuples is called the *cardinality* of the table, and the number of attributes is called the *degree* of the table.

Column or combination of columns that uniquely identify each row in the table is called the *primary key* of the table.

A *domain* is a collection of values from which one or more attribute (columns) draw their actual values.

`NULL` value is used to represent missing information in a table.

The column in one table whose value matches the primary key in some other table is called the *foreign key*.
