### **What are Angular Services?**

Angular services are used to encapsulate logic or code that can be shared across multiple components in an application. A service is typically used for:

- Managing data and business logic
- Handling HTTP requests
- Storing state that needs to be accessed by multiple components

By using services, you can promote reusability, maintainability, and separation of concerns within your application.

### **How to Create an Angular Service?**

To create a service, you can use Angular CLI:

```CMD
ng g service Calculator
```

This command will generate a service file `calculator.service.ts` that you can use to handle logic related to calculations or other tasks in your application.

### **Service Example**

Hereâ€™s a basic example of an Angular service that performs arithmetic calculations:

```typescript
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';

@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root'
})
export class CalculatorService {
  
  constructor() { }

  add(x: number, y: number): number {
    return x + y;
  }

  subtract(x: number, y: number): number {
    return x - y;
  }

  multiply(x: number, y: number): number {
    return x * y;
  }

  divide(x: number, y: number): number {
    return x / y;
  }
}
```

In this example, the `CalculatorService` has methods to add, subtract, multiply, and divide two numbers.

### **Using the Service in a Component**

To use the `CalculatorService` in a component, follow these steps:

1. **Inject the service into the component** by adding it to the constructor.

```typescript
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { CalculatorService } from './calculator.service';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-calculator',
  templateUrl: './calculator.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./calculator.component.css']
})
export class CalculatorComponent {
  result: number = 0;

  constructor(private calculatorService: CalculatorService) { }

  add() {
    this.result = this.calculatorService.add(5, 3);
  }

  subtract() {
    this.result = this.calculatorService.subtract(5, 3);
  }

  multiply() {
    this.result = this.calculatorService.multiply(5, 3);
  }

  divide() {
    this.result = this.calculatorService.divide(6, 3);
  }
}
```

2. **Use the service methods** to perform operations within the component.

In the component, methods like `add()`, `subtract()`, `multiply()`, and `divide()` call the corresponding service methods and store the result in the `result` variable.

### **Service Providers**

- Services can be **provided** in several ways in Angular. The most common way is by using the `providedIn` property in the `@Injectable` decorator. By setting `providedIn: 'root'`, Angular will automatically provide the service at the root level.
    
    ```typescript
    @Injectable({
      providedIn: 'root'
    })
    export class CalculatorService {
      // service methods
    }
    ```
    
- Alternatively, you can provide services at the **component level** or **module level** if needed.

### **Summary of Angular Services**

- **Encapsulation**: Services encapsulate logic or business functionality that can be shared across components.
- **Reusability**: Services allow you to reuse functionality in multiple components, reducing redundancy.
- **Dependency Injection**: Services are injected into components, allowing for easier testing and flexibility.
- **Common Use Cases**: Services are often used for handling HTTP requests, managing data, or providing common utility functions.

By using Angular services effectively, you can keep your components clean, maintainable, and organized.
