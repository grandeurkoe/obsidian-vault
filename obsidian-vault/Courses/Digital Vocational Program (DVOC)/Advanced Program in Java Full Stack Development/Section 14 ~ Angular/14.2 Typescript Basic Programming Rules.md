## **TypeScript Syntax and Structure**

### **1. Case Sensitivity**

- **TypeScript is case-sensitive**. This means that **`foo`** is **not the same** as **`Foo`**.
    - Example:
        ```typescript
        let foo = 10;
        let Foo = 20;
        console.log(foo);  // Outputs 10
        console.log(Foo);  // Outputs 20
        ```

### **2. Program Flow**

- A **typical TypeScript program** consists of a sequence of statements that control the flow of the program.
- Statements are executed in a **sequential manner**, and you can control the flow using loops, conditionals, and functions.

### **3. Semicolons (`;`)**

- The **semicolon (`;`)** is used to indicate the **end of a statement**.
    - Example:
        ```typescript
        let x = 5;  // statement ends with semicolon
        let y = 10; // another statement
        ```
- **Note**: TypeScript allows **automatic semicolon insertion (ASI)**, so omitting semicolons is possible, but it’s considered a best practice to include them to avoid confusion.

### **4. Whitespace (Spaces, Tabs, Newlines)**

- You can add **spaces**, **tabs**, and **newlines** anywhere in the TypeScript program. The **TypeScript compiler ignores** them.
    - These are used for **indentation** and **formatting** to make the code **easily readable**.
    - Example:
        ```typescript
        let name = "John";
        let age = 30;
        
        if(age > 18) {
            console.log(name + " is an adult.");
        }
        ```
    - In the example above, spaces and newlines make the code readable but are ignored by the TypeScript compiler.

### **5. Comments in TypeScript**

#### **5.1. Single-line Comments (`//`)**

- A **single-line comment** begins with **`//`**. Everything after `//` on that line is ignored by the compiler.
    - Example:
        ```typescript
        let x = 10; // This is a single-line comment
        ```

#### **5.2. Multi-line Comments (`/* */`)**

- **Multi-line comments** can span multiple lines. These comments begin with `/*` and end with `*/`.
    - Example:
        ```typescript
        /* This is a multi-line comment
           that spans multiple lines. */
        let y = 20;
        ```

#### **5.3. Documentation Comments (`/** */`)**

- **Documentation comments** are similar to multi-line comments but are used for generating documentation.
- They start with `/**` and end with `*/`. These comments are used to describe the functionality of classes, methods, or functions.
    - Example:
        ```typescript
        /**
         * This function adds two numbers.
         * @param a - The first number
         * @param b - The second number
         * @returns The sum of a and b
         */
        function add(a: number, b: number): number {
            return a + b;
        }
        ```

---

## **Expressions**

- An **expression** is any unit of code that produces a **value**. Expressions can appear anywhere in the program, such as in function arguments, assignments, or conditional statements.
    - **Examples of expressions**:
        - **Arithmetic expressions**: `x + y`, `a * b`
        - **Logical expressions**: `a && b`, `x || y`
        - **Function call**: `add(5, 10)`
        - **Object property**: `person.name`
    - **Example**:
        ```typescript
        let result = 10 + 5;  // 10 + 5 is an expression
        ```
    - Expressions can be part of more complex constructs like function arguments or on the right side of an assignment statement.

## **Summary of Key Syntax Elements**

1. **Case Sensitivity**: TypeScript is case-sensitive (`foo` ≠ `Foo`).
2. **Semicolons**: Used to indicate the end of a statement.
3. **Whitespace**: Spaces, tabs, and newlines can be freely added for readability.
4. **Comments**:
    - **Single-line comments**: `// comment`
    - **Multi-line comments**: `/* comment */`
    - **Documentation comments**: `/** comment */`
5. **Expressions**: Code units that produce a value, used throughout the program.

By following these conventions and using these syntax rules, you can write **clean**, **readable**, and **maintainable** TypeScript code.
