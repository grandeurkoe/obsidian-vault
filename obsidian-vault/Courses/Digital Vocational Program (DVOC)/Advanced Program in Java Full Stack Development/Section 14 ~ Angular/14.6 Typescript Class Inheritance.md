### **TypeScript Class Inheritance and the `extends` Keyword**

TypeScript provides a way for one class to **inherit** from another class using the `extends` keyword. This allows a child class to inherit properties and methods from a parent class, promoting **code reusability** and a more **structured design**.

---

### **Concepts of Inheritance:**

1. **Single Inheritance:**
    - In TypeScript, a class can only **extend one other class** (single inheritance). However, it can implement multiple interfaces.
2. **`extends` Keyword:**
    - The `extends` keyword is used to create a subclass (child class) that inherits from a superclass (parent class).
    - The subclass inherits the public and protected members (properties and methods) from the parent class, but it can override or extend them as needed.
3. **Calling the Parent Constructor:**
    - When a subclass is created, it can call the parent class's constructor using the `super()` function. This is used to initialize properties from the parent class.
4. **Interfaces and Inheritance:**
    - A class can implement one or more interfaces using the `implements` keyword, which defines the structure or contract a class must follow. In the example, `Rectangle` implements the `Shape` interface to ensure it has the `getArea` method.

---

### **Example: Inheritance with `extends` and `implements`**

```typescript
// Define an interface Shape that requires a method 'getArea'
interface Shape {
    getArea: () => number;
}

// Base class Rectangle implementing Shape interface
class Rectangle implements Shape {
    // Protected properties can be accessed by subclasses
    public constructor(protected readonly width: number, protected readonly height: number) {}

    // Implement the getArea method from Shape interface
    public getArea(): number {
        return this.width * this.height;
    }
}

// Derived class Square extends Rectangle
class Square extends Rectangle {
    // Constructor takes only 'width' as a parameter for square (width = height)
    public constructor(width: number) {
        // Call the parent constructor with width and width (height = width)
        super(width, width);
    }
}

// Create instances of Rectangle and Square
const rectangle = new Rectangle(10, 20);
console.log(`Area of Rectangle: ${rectangle.getArea()}`); // 200

const square = new Square(5);
console.log(`Area of Square: ${square.getArea()}`); // 25
```

### **Key Points of Inheritance in TypeScript:**

1. **Single Inheritance (`extends` keyword):**
    - A class can **extend** only one other class. In the example, the `Square` class **extends** `Rectangle`, which allows it to inherit the `getArea` method.
2. **Interface Implementation (`implements` keyword):**
    - The `Rectangle` class **implements** the `Shape` interface, which guarantees that it must have a `getArea` method.
    - Interfaces are **not inherited** but can be **implemented** by classes to enforce structure.
3. **Calling `super()` in the Constructor:**
    - In the child class (`Square`), the **`super()`** method is called inside the constructor to invoke the parent class (`Rectangle`) constructor and initialize inherited properties (in this case, `width` and `height`).
4. **Protected Members:**
    - The **`protected`** access modifier allows a property or method to be accessible within the class and its subclasses, but not from outside the class. In the example, `width` and `height` are protected, so they can be accessed in `Square`, but not directly outside of the `Rectangle` class.

---

### **Inheritance Flow Example:**

- **Class `Rectangle`** defines:
    - Properties: `width`, `height` (protected and readonly).
    - Method: `getArea()` which returns the area of the rectangle.
- **Class `Square`** extends `Rectangle`:
    - It uses the `super(width, width)` call to initialize the `Rectangle` class with the same value for both width and height, essentially making it a square.
- **Interfaces** (such as `Shape`) define the required structure for classes, ensuring that they implement necessary methods (in this case, `getArea`).

### **Advantages of Inheritance in TypeScript:**

1. **Code Reusability:**
    - You can reuse code from a parent class by inheriting its functionality in a subclass. This reduces redundancy and simplifies code maintenance.
2. **Extending Behavior:**
    - Subclasses can **extend** or **override** methods and properties from the parent class, providing more specialized behavior as needed.
3. **Polymorphism:**
    - With inheritance, subclasses can implement the same interface or override methods to provide specific implementations, supporting polymorphism.
4. **Encapsulation:**
    - The use of **access modifiers** like `private`, `protected`, and `public` helps to ensure that data is encapsulated and can only be accessed in appropriate ways.

### **Final Thought:**

Inheritance in TypeScript is a powerful tool to promote **code reuse** and **organization**. By using the `extends` keyword, you can create classes that build upon existing ones, and by implementing interfaces, you can enforce class structure and consistency across your application.
