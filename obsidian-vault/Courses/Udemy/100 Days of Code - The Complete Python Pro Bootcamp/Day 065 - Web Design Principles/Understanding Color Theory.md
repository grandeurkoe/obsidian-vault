Color theory is the art or science of creating  the right color pallet for your website.

When picking colors you have to be aware of the mood of your color pallet.

Website usually incorporate multiple colors. So designers rely on scientific way of combining colors. For example, taking two colors that are right next to each other on the color wheel. Combining these will create an analogous color pallet.

These analogous color pallet are good for navigation bar, logo and its background,  and the body of your website.

However analogous color pallet do not pop out as much i.e. they are not very attention grabbing.

Choosing two colors opposite to each other on the color wheel can be good for grabbing attention. A pallet constructed from combing these two colors is called as complementary color pallet.

Do not use complementary color pallet to style text and it's background. Use complementary color pallet for logos to make them stand out.
