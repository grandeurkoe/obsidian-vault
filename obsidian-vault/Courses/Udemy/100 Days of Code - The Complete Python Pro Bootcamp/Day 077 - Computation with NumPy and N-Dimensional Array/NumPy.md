# NumPy

No Data Science course can be complete without learning NumPy (**Numerical Python**). NumPy is a Python library thatâ€™s used in almost every field of science and engineering. Itâ€™s practically **THE** standard for working with numerical data in Python. The case studies for how NumPy is being used speak for themselves ðŸ˜®

So far, weâ€™ve been using Pandas, which is built on top of NumPy. Think of Pandas as a high-level data manipulation tool that includes functionality for working with time-series or for grouping, joining, merging and finding missing data (i.e., everything weâ€™ve been doing so far). NumPy on the other hand shines with low-level tasks, like doing serious math and calculations.
