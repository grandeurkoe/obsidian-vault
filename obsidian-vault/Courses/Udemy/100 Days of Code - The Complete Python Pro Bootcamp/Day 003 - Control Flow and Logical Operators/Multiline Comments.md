# Multiline Comments

If I want to add comments over multiple line then I can use Triple commas. Anything between 2 Triple commas is treated as comment.

```python
print('''
	  
	  ''')
```

>[!Warning]
>If you forget to add an ending triple comma then everything after the starting triple comma is treated as a comment.
