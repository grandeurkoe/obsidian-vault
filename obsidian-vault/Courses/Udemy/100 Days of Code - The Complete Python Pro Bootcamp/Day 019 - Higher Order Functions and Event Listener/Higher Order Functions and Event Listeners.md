# Higher Order Functions and Event Listeners

## Higher Order Functions

Higher Order Functions are functions that can work with other functions.

You can implement Higher Order Functions like this -
```python
def add(n1 ,n2):
	return n1 + n2
def calculator(n1, n2, func)
	return func(n1, n2)
calculator(2, 3 , add)
```

Higher Order Functions is a special feature of Python.

## Event Listeners

To bind a key to an action we have to use an event listener.
