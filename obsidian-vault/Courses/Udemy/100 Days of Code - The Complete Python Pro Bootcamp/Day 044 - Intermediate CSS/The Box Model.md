# The Box Model

Margin, padding, border, height and width together form a very important CSS concept called the Box Model.

`height` and `width` properties can either be set as pixel or as percentage of the screen like this -
```css
height: 600px;
height: 100%
```

Border property takes three values, each separated by a space. The first value being thickness, second being the style of the border and third being the color of the border.
