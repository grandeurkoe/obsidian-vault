Paragraph element is used for formatting and putting text on our website.

This is what a paragraph element looks like:

```html
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
```

Here,
- `<p>` is the opening tag.
- `</p>` is the closing tag.
- `This is a paragraph.`is the content of the `p` element.

## Why use the paragraph element?

Plain text written in your HTML document will appear side by side when you view the rendered code.

Code:
```html
This is a paragraph.
This is a paragraph.
```

Output:
```OUTPUT
This is paragraph.This is a paragraph.
```

Instead, if we had created two paragraph elements for these two lines.

Code:
```html
<p>This is a paragraph.<p>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
```

Output:
```OUTPUT
This is paragraph.
This is a paragraph.
```

Paragraph element is also very important for people that use screen reader because what the screen reader will do is theyâ€™ll see the beginning of each paragraph and allow blind users to be able to skip paragraphs easily.
