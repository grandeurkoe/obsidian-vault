**Image elements** are used to add images to your website.

Image element looks like this:

```html
<img src="https://picsum.photos/200" alt="random image of size 200 * 200"/>
```

Here,
- `<img />` is a void element.
- `src` attribute refers to the source of the image or the location of the image.
- `alt` attribute stands for alternative text description. This attribute provides alternative text that screen readers use to assist visually impaired individuals.
