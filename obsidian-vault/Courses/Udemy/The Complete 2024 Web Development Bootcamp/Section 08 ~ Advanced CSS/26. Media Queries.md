```css
@media (max-width: 600px) {
	h2 {
		font-size: 15px;
	}
}
```

Here,
- Replace CSS selectors with `@media`.
- The content inside the set of round braces is the `breakpoint`. This essentially says that at this particular width, anything less than or equal to 600px, apply the styling defined inside the media query.
- You can also use `min-width` as a breakpoint.

```css
@media (min-width: 600px)  amd (max-width: 900px){
	h2 {
		font-size: 15px;
	}
}
```

You can use the `and`  keyword to combine breakpoints and provide a range.
