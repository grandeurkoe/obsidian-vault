Here, we will combine selectors to select a specific element.

For example,
```css
p {
	color: yellow;
}
.inner-box p {
	color:white;
}
```

Here,
- Set `color` as white for all `p` element descendants of `inner-box` class.

## Different ways you can combine CSS selectors

### Group rule

Done using comma (,). To separate selectors, we use comma.

For example,
```css
selector, selector {
	color: blueviolet;
}
```

Here,
- CSS rule will be applied to both the selectors.

### Child rule

Use right angled bracket (>) in order to select a child of another selector.

For example,
```css
selector > selector {
	color: firebrick;
}
```

Here,
- First `selector` is parent and second `selector` is child. Child is the direct descendant of the parent.

### Descendent rule

For example,
```css
selector selector {
	color: blue;
}
```

Here,
- First `selector` is the ancestor and second `selector` is the descendant. CSS rule will be applied to any valid descendant, no matter how deep inside it is.

### Chaining rule

In chaining rule, apply CSS rule to the instances where all the selectors are true or present.

Always start with element selector.

For example,
```css
selector.selector#selector {
	color: seagreen;
}
```

### Combining Combiners

In combining combiners, we can combine above rules.

For example,
```css
selector selectorselector {
	color: seagreen;
}
```
